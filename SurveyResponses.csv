"Other than the cost-saving measures that will be enacted, I see as a potential improvement an increase in collaboration between departments of each new school. This could lead to interesting and interdisciplinary programming of new events. I do not foresee any downsides to this restructuring plan.","As I mentioned above, I believe that this restructuring has the possibility for faculty in my department to collaborate with faculty from other departments in the same school, both for teaching but especially with respect to programming of new events organized by the new schools. ","I do think that where faculty/departments are physically located can either help or hinder new potential for collaboration. As it now stands, there will be several faculty members in our new school who will continue to be located in a very different part of campus. If we believe that these new schools will be here to stay for decades to come, I would strongly encourage administration to begin to consider a relocation plan of certain departments so that faculty from the same schools are within closer proximity to each other, ideally within the same building.  "
"I think the proposed model could significantly improve the organization of UMW at most levels. I'm not sure I see a large benefit for my department (especially given that we do not fit neatly as a unit into humanities, as some of us are social scientists), but I think it will benefit other departments by providing some more focused attention, while still encouraging interdisciplinary opportunities. For example, the discussions surrounding the school of humanities is encouraging--having a central focus for humanities work that could offer the multiple departments an opportunity for fundraising efforts, interdisciplinary cooperation among the humanities departments, and, by the new structure, allowing our dean to actually do the work that many deans outside of UMW are able to do. I think this will greatly help departments that are struggling with numbers--through departmental efforts, but also through a greater school effort, there might be more opportunities to recruit and maintain students. ","I don't think it does. We are already an interdisciplinary group. My own personal concern was about the fact that we don't all fit into a ""humanities"" designation, but, so long as we can all still do the work we do, I'm not quite concerned about that. ","I can't speak for other programs or the larger restructuring, but I'm not sure I have suggestions--I think it's time to move forward and not to pump the brakes. "
"I think some of the groupings make a lot of sense. In my area, the Humanities, I see it possibly fostering better collaboration and innovation between the programs. However, I don't see the new university structure overall making a lot of difference either in terms of saving money or in recruitment. In some units (Computer Science especially) I see potential harm, including losing valuable faculty who have the possibility of better opportunities. ","In our case, I hope that by working with other Humanities disciplines we can increase language enrollments and find ways to promote the importance of languages and cultures. ","Provost O'Donnell created a structure that is nicely balanced and saved a little money. That is great from an administrator's point of view, but not necessarily good for all programs. I think the school idea should be reserved for the areas where that makes sense in terms of programs, recruitment and retention, and fundraising. The School of the Arts makes a lot of sense, as does the School of Science for those reasons. The School for the Humanities makes sense if we think of that unit as not only promoting their academic programs, but also interacting with the public more through a Center for the Humanities. Allowing the social sciences to group in units (not one school) that they think make the most sense might solve those problems. Same for Computer Science and Mathematics. Maybe instead of putting the latter under a dean and associate dean in Business, they could be a school of computational science with their own school director? "
"I don't see any particular issue with the new model, and it seems to be an improvement in dividing work and resources more evenly across the departments.",,
,,"I completely agree with the points Stephen Davies made in his email to all faculty on 2/26.  In particular, I would like to reiterate two of these points:
(1) In general, if any faculty unit unanimously objects to where they are positioned in the plan, I call for the administration to come up with a different solution for that unit. 
(2) In particular, since the CPSC faculty unanimously believe that a Business College is the wrong place for them, I support them and ask the administration to change that part of the plan."
"The only advantage I see is that it attempts to even out the number of faculty in each college. This is an important goal, but the proposed model does this in an unnecessarily complicated way. If we are going to have 3 colleges then they should be created based on the needs of the University, not based on the 3 Deans we currently have.  Each Dean will move on at some point but we will still be stuck with this model. College of Arts and Humanities, Colleges of Sciences, College of Professional Studies (or some other fancy name).  That is it. Make Education and Business ""schools"" in the 3rd college and they can have a department leader like everyone else. They don't need a Dean to help with reaccreditation. If we can have one faculty member (thanks, Nicole!) run reaccreditation for the entire University then certainly one faculty member in Education and Business can be in charge of it in their respective departments. And it is not like the enormous financial investment we have made of the past 15 years in having Deans/separate colleges for Business and Education has paid off. The data clearly show downward numbers in each of those programs.  Stop falling for the ""sunk-cost"" fallacy; we don't need to keep throwing good money after bad investments. It is time to move on. I am fine with creating 3 new colleges to deal with the uneven faculty numbers and administrative burdens we currently have, but lets do it in a smart way that actually solves problems that we have.  Other limitations:  1) Even after several conversations with the Dean I still don't understand why we need school directors and what they would actually do.  It seems like another level of administration that is unnecessary.  If some areas feel like having a Director would be helpful that is fine.  Give someone a course release or two to lead it.  But don't impose this on everyone else unless the need and position is much more clearly defined.  2) Combining departments:  the only reason I can see for this is that we can save a little money on department chair salaries, but those savings are then lost with program directors.  Combining departments doesn't solve SCHEV issues with small numbers of graduates and only seems to be creating more problems. Departments have important identities not only for our current students and faculty, but also for alumni.  Why would we mess with that unless we absolutely had too? 3) The proposed model seems to rely on ""cross-disciplinary"" collaborations as a selling point. Do you really think having administrators telling faculty they must do cross-disciplinary work is going to change things. Provide more support directly to faculty (how about a course release when conducting researching/teaching with someone in a different discipline) rather than paying another administrator to encourage this. 4) Cost-savings?  Cleary an important objective.  But as far as I can tell we would not be saving very much money.  Out of our over $100 million a year budget, maybe $100k at the absolute most. And that is a stretch.  That is minimal savings for the issues it is creating.  ",I doubt it will improve anything for my department.  It will just add another administrative layer above the department chair to deal with.,"From my earlier comments.  If we are going to have 3 colleges then they should be created based on the needs of the University, not based on the 3 Deans we currently have.

"I don't feel that this model will really improve organization at the departmental, college, or university level.  Splitting into schools will create an extra level of bureaucracy that doesn't seem to have much value added for any of us.  For some of us in Arts and Sciences, the change doesn't seem like it will make a huge difference, with the exception of being part of a School (that the students likely won't realize it exists) in addition to part of a college.  For others, however, who will be moving from Arts and Sciences to COB, it seems that the change will bring about many new issues as they will now be under a dean who has a completely different way of operating and doesn't understand CPSC. I feel that things were so much better here at UMW before we split into three colleges in terms of how more unified our faculty was.  I fear that this change into several new schools will just work to further divide us with little, if any, gain financially or otherwise.  The proposed AACPR department is forming under the idea of having power in numbers since there are departments who are currently well under the threshold but doing so won't necessary change anything in terms of SCHEV.  It will, however, change organizational structure with other departments as Sociology will now need to merge with another department and it seems that it would make more sense for Art History to remain with Art.",This model doesn't seem like it will cause much disruption for my department.  It seems like being part of the School of the Humanities will bring about more meetings --I do wonder how attendance will be at those since there are a bunch of faculty that only come to campus twice a week.....  There is the potential for some interesting exchanges and dialogue within the school but not sure how much that will happen in reality.  Even sharing the building with colleagues it's amazing how little I run into many of these colleagues.,"I feel that the move to add CPSC and Math to the College of Business doesn't make sense and will cause more harm than good.  The issue of balancing out workload between the Deans is complicated as the formation of the COB and COE in first place (both of which have fewer faculty members than English).  It is obvious that the Dean of CAS is the main dean and will have a more substantial workload than COB and COE since CAS is the majority, and the heart of the institution. If everything is really ""on the table"", moving away from the three college system would bring folks together more and would definitely bring down our costs.  Back in my early years here we just had a Faculty Senate with more representation and there was only a department chair for COB, not a dean and associate dean.  There was much lower overhead.  And now we have fewer students and more faculty than we had then."
"The reorganization plan as proposed, especially when including the current draft of School Director position descriptions, risks raising barriers to current and potential interdisciplinary collaborations and programs. Students both want to and need help to make these connections.  A currently written, School Directors are supposed to support and advocate for the programs within them and to foster connections among those departments. There's nothing in the descriptions about enhancing connections across schools.   School Directors should be evaluated in part on their ability to foster such collaborations. One method would be to encourage departments to name faculty in other schools as affiliate faculty.

The current plan forces departments in the ""physical and life sciences"" and ""social sciences"" to merge even though the proposed forced mergers do not reflect the interests of students in those departments. The ""savings"" realized through mergers is miniscule in comparison to the overall university budget and certainly do not outweigh the damage to programs such forced mergers will cause.

The current plan places programs in schools and colleges that do not reflect their curricula, faculty expertise, or student interests. Only programs that want to be combined into schools should be combined into schools.

There is no rationale given as to how this plan improves the university's ability to recruit or retain students. ","Geography and Geospatial Analysis are not social science programs. They are sciences of spatial synthesis where students learn to integrate knowledge learned in climate science, geomorphology, cultural geography, political-economic geography, GIS, remote sensing, and other subdisciplines in order to become effective planners, environmental advocates, policy researchers, intelligence analysts, and geospatial analysts. Reducing Geography and Geospatial Analysis to a social science harms our students' ability to make the connections that allow them to understand place and scientifically explain spatial patterns. 

Similarly, placing Geography and Geospatial Analysis in a merged department, such as sociology, marginalizes the students and faculty interested in geographic information science, climate science, and environmental studies. 

If admissions and university communications uses the schools and merged departments to organize the way we market our programs to prospective students, then we will lose students who want to study Geography and Geospatial Analysis (along with many other programs across the university) 

Geography is one the most effective fundraising departments in the University. Our students identify with the department and become alumni who support our Geography and Geospatial Analysis programs with their time, their talents, and their treasure. Placing these programs in a School of Social Science and, especially, merging us with another department threatens our identify and our strong relationships with students and alumni.","1. Programs should not be grouped into schools or colleges unless it is clearly beneficial to those programs.  If Theater, Music, and Art benefit by being parts of a School of Art, then they should be allowed to. But if Political Science, History, Geography, Computer Science and other programs don't benefit, then they should not have to be assigned to schools. We need a more flexible model. Colleagues in several departments are preparing such models.
2. As stated above, departments should not be forced to merge. The cost savings of reducing the number of chairs doesn't justify the costs in recruitment and retention that will result.
3. For any schools and colleges that do emerge from the plan, their directors and member programs should be specifically encouraged to foster interdisciplinary collaborations of students and faculty between schools. For example, naming affiliated faculty, will help students, administrators, career services and admissions staff better understand the ways our programs are already interconnected.
4. Communication and admissions marketing of all programs, regardless of how they are organized, must be done for programs and not for schools or departments unless it is clearly  beneficial.  In other words, all programs have their own websites, admissions helps students find programs that match their interests by program rather than by department or school, career services provides advice based on programs and not based on schools or department, etc.
5. The University should prioritize investing in systems that help students see connections across our divisions and colleges. For example, prospective students should be able to enter their interests in a web form and get a list of programs and courses related to those interests.  And when searching for gen ed and elective courses, current students should be able to use keywords that help them find courses the match their interests."
"-This structure has more potential for shared teaching and research and perhaps increased communication for governance purposes for CAS schools and possibly also COE. I don't see as much potential with the proposed new COB. Part of how we got to this place is because communication has been uneven and people have felt uninformed, uninvolved, or underrepresented. Sometimes special working groups are formed outside of the existing structure (the reorg group is one example). Optimistically, I see the potential for less of that in the future with this structure because more people will be seen as able to represent their colleagues and work across traditional departments and units. By cementing units administratively and not just in name only (the ""division reps"" for UFC, for example), I think communication and governance could improve.
-I think undergraduates conducting research, especially honors students, could benefit as often their questions do not fall along strict disciplinary lines. They often do interdisciplinary work and if we are living that through our structure, they can learn from us about how to think outside limited disciplinary boxes. Maybe they have two mentors within one school or across schools or even across colleges. That happens now, but it's rare. Sure, some of us aren't social scientists and some of us do research that is more quant or qual, etc--at the end of the day, our main goal is to educate students effectively for the future. We want our students to be open to change, so we should be as well. 
-Preserving lower enrolled programs is important, and this seems to help with that issue. ","-The service burden (one stated original reason for the reorg) will probably not be reduced by much for COE unless the nursing and athletic faculty serve on university committees, which I believe is not common practice for most of them now
-To a previous point about local control, if we remove all local control we'd have zero department chairs, and I don't think that's something people want. Some chairs are removed in this structure, which will be an adjustment--that will affect others more than COE so I defer to their perspective on that. ","-define the roles of the deans, associate deans, program director, school directors, department chairs, etc. Who does what? Through this it could be clear what counts as innovating and what would be more like an overreach or inappropriate decisionmaking or directive from those in admin positions.
-some of the mentioned benefits could be realized through a clear model of credit/workload for faculty--for example, when they supervise student research, what kind of time is expected, and what kind of credit do they get, if any? That will shine a light on priorities about whether collaboration is possible and encouraged or just a thing that is cool to have but is not valued or compensated. 
-clarify what staff support will look like and whether these jobs will change. For example, if an admin coordinator now serves a unit that will be combined with other units, will they serve all of the new units? Will there be three+ admin coordinators under one ""unit""? 
-move CPSC out of COB per recent comments shared by SD email. That seems like a mismatch. What about math? I am curious about their thoughts. "
I see no potential to improve organization of UMW at any level. I am very confused about how this will help with student recruitment and retention,Will not have a significant impact,
"(A) We solved the most urgent SCHEV-created problem when small departments agreed to combine. (B) We can't solve the recruitment problem: we've been told that students won't be affected, making it unlikely that reorganization will attract more students. (C) That leaves the problem of helping the CAS Dean have a more balanced workload. Why not just give him more help or more money? ","Creative Writing is not an art, while historic preservation is? How extraordinarily odd! (Has anyone considered what Homer, Shakespeare, or Toni Morrison would say to that?) ","Remove CPSC and MATH from College of Business. Putting them there shows an unbounded ignorance of both fields. (Also ask ECON if they think they belong there.) 

Combine School of the Arts and School of Humanities so the creative production courses in ENLI (e.g., all of creative writing) and CMDS (e.g., film production, digital storytelling) have a sensible home.

Ask SOCG and GEOG if they are happier together than in their former configurations.

Prepare for a deluge of confused pre-meds wondering whether to do the Biomed major or join the College of Education and Health.

Stop focusing on Dean workload and focus on keeping UMW open: if it won't attract new students, skip it."
"Improve:  split the faculty more evenly rather than having three colleges that are equal but one  actually has 80-90% of the teaching faculty, provide opportunities for targeted recruitment efforts and fundraising, reduce administration to some degree overall, give opportunities for and in some cases force multidisciplinary work between departments, give the arts especially their own ""areas"" of influence, cost savings (I wish there was more cost savings)

Weaken:  this structure doesn't weaken much at all at UMW although many teaching faculty seem to think it does, this structure makes a start at cost savings but I wish it did much more, UMW will have to come to grips with the idea that we have the same number of students we had about 20 years ago and many more faculty members.",There will be inevitable disruption but change will always involve disruption.,"Reduce the number of ""chairs"" from what is proposed.  Perhaps merge more departments.  Take a good look at the number and variety of titles, reduce the titles and bring them in line with one another. I count eight different titles in the new organization:  dean, assoc dean, school director, program director, director, executive director, athletic director, and chair.  That are far too many and  it is incredibly confusing.  The names of the schools and colleges need to be reconsidered.  CMDS and ENLI need to be under a single chair."
I see the plan as supporting our mission and creating a more balanced service. ,This does not disrupt our programs. It may help us with community connections. This is only seen as positive through my analysis. ,None noted. 
"Rosalyn Cooperman, PS/IA: This reorganization plan in its current iteration – proposed as costing no jobs and closing no programs – sets up a permission structure to do both in the future when said consolidation demonstrates no value in supporting major programs in trouble or boosting overall enrollment. 

I do not take issue with a need to make workload more equitable or put forward a plan that is fiscally thoughtful. I do take issue with a reorganization plan that moves us away from the values we tell prospective and current students and their families that we embrace but do not sufficiently support in many of our practices. 

Several of my colleagues have ably described the shortcomings of the current reorganization plan, so I will focus my efforts on a very important thread of the conversation that has been overlooked – curricular changes that would better allow UMW to demonstrate its value to prospective and current students as the place for substantive, meaningful learning and professional development opportunities. We keep hearing about this survey or that study that lays bare the very real challenges institutions of higher education face; these data points make clear the need to embrace policies that personalize the educational and professional development experiences for our students. And we are already well positioned to do just that with small class sizes, highly qualified faculty teaching in their areas of expertise, and a regional economy (https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/summary/blssummary_washington.pdf) that is chock-full of employers who want to hire resourceful and well-educated workers. The most recent example of “headwinds” UMW and other higher ed institutions face as identified in the Burning Glass survey (https://stradaeducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Talent-Disrupted.pdf?utm_source=StradaEducation.org&utm_medium=Website&utm_campaign=TalentDisrupted&utm_content)is the problem of underemployment among college-educated individuals. In its recommendations, Burning Glass identifies high quality internships as the antidote to underemployment.  Coming out of last year’s SACSCOC reaffirmation of accreditation, we pledged to focus on developing and strengthening our After Mary Washington focus on connecting learning to professional development. And, the Fall 2023 Reorganization Working Group discussed many ideas related to curricular changes that would allow our students to take full advantage of our remarkable geographic location between two capitals. Many of our departments already do this, but there is always room for improvement and greater intention in linking education, field of study, and professional development. 

For example, those of us in the Social Science disciplines believe we can gain substantive leverage by more explicitly centering our programs around the concept of community engagement – not just the activities that students engage in while here at UMW but how those practices match up with careers in community engagement that include work across public and private sectors. Working with the Center for Community Engagement and the Career Center we can focus on engaging with the community, working with local and regional organizations and employers to help meet their needs and serve our students interests and aspirations. Where are those ideas in the reorganization plan?  Radio silence. By focusing on merging departments and shifting others into spaces that make no pedagogical sense we are making it harder to demonstrate that we DO understand what students, their families, and prospective employers want from a college education.  

Workload issues are not the same as enrollment issues. Any reorganization plan needs to have strategies for addressing each pressing issue. The current plan that lumps these two challenges together will fail to sufficiently address either of them, kill departments and programs, and leave us in a further weakened position to attract and retain students.  ","Merging Political Science & International Affairs with History and American Studies would signal to students that these programs are of diminished importance and value despite our programs' established track records in providing an outstanding educational experience for our students and strengthening their writing, speaking, and analytical skills - skills that are both expected and valued by employers. ",Separate workload rebalancing imperatives from embracing curricular changes to more explicitly connect education to professional development and take full advantage of our geographical location between two capitals with a well developed regional economy. Employers want well-educated and trained employees. That should be our explicit charge moving forward as a center piece to attract and retain students. 
"Administrators are leaders, and leaders are servants of the people whom they lead. As proposed, the model creates MORE layers of administration thereby increasing relational distance between leaders (Deans) and the people whom they serve (faculty). The proposed model weakens the entirety of the university because it does not strengthen connection between the people who do the work of education and those who support and facilitate it.","I am actually in favor of reorganization. I think the School Director idea could work with a flatter structure, like in Arts (4 Program Directors).  But, the consolidation of already-stretched departments in Jepson felt like a sucker punch to folks over here, and people as a whole are fairly bitter about the ""don't worry about Jepson sentiment"" only to see the change significant.  A move like that would disrupt what we're trying to do, even for the folks over here who ARE in favor of a reorganization.","In physics, we solve problems by taking a singular problem and breaking it apart into smaller pieces. The proposed model seeks to take several complex problems and solve them with a singular remedy. That is not the way difficult problems have been solved historically.  

Rather than restructuring the faculty and their units around the already existing three-colleges, three-deans model, perhaps the Deans need to seem themselves with greater flexibility and envision themselves in a new light.  A three-college structure where the Arts were separate from the Sciences but could basically run independently might work.  College of Sciences, College of Education & Arts, and College of Humanities (which includes Business).  THIS would redistribute faculty responsibilities more equally among the Deans, which is only one of the four complex problems.  From there, within that solved structure, one then sets out to solve the next complicated problem. "
Our department is large enough that it won't have much effect but I wonder how Anthropology and Art History feel combining with the already somewhat disparate CPR.   Or how CompSci feels about being lumped with COB.  Or how Physics and Environmental Science would feel if grouped together.,"Again, I don't see that it will have much if any effect on us, but we are among those ""at risk"" in SCHEV's eyes so I would like to see a plan that *does* have an effect on us.",I don't understand the purpose of the reorg.  It only seems to address the unequal distribution of work for the deans and perhaps slightly reduce costs with the elimination of CAS Assistant and Associate Dean. It doesn't address SCHEV's concerns for departments with low grad # or the impending demographic cliff.
"I can see new conversations happening within grouped programs that have not happened in recent years (and maybe ever) and those conversations might be productive and interesting. Even the conversations about what is wrong with the proposed reorganization have resulted in productive articulations of program identities. 

I am concerned that devolving budgets from the Dean's office to the school directors will lock in inequalities between school. While there is potential for interdisciplinary connections within the schools, I fear that it will be harder across schools (and interdisciplinary connections are more vibrant and more interesting across those boundaries than within them). This creates bigger silos, but I fear that they are less porous.
","As a department that does not fit in one school, it risks marginalizing parts of our programs and making us less visible or attractive to students in other schools. 

As a new chair, a lot of my time has been focused on program level issues -- CIP codes, increasing declared majors, developing new interdisciplinary majors, etc. How does this work happen in merged departments? Its either unpaid or it doesn't happen. And if we are spending the next couple of years focused on social science or humanities or natural science issues how do we build programs that cross those borders?  

We have a Physical and Environmental concentration in our department that requires no more than three social science classes. Will students understand it in the context of a school of social sciences. We have a Geospatial Analysis major.  We have a GIS Certificate that is completed by students across the university, but mostly students in the new schools of Art and Natural Science and COB.

Geography is very uncomfortable in this proposed reorganization. Because we are a broad discipline, narrow divisions don't reflect who we are and what we do.  ","Having a ""group director"" or ""cluster director"" but leaving most CAS departments in the College of arts and sciences would provide a way of decreasing Keith's management load without reifying divisions.

"
I was particularly encouraged by Keith's proposal of a center for the study of humanities.   Before coming to UMW, I taught for thirty years at Brown that has a thriving and generously endowed humanities center.  The Cogut Institute for Humanities funds grants for faculty research and course development, and for student research. It also organizes conferences and symposia. It was established in the 1990's with a donation from alumni, the Coguts, and has since received big grants from Mellon ($1.3 million) and other foundations. This is their website:
https://humanities.brown.edu/about ",It could only improve it.,"Establish a center for the study of humanities. The development office should be consulted for the names of donors to UMW, such as the people who helped fund the new science building, for submitting a proposal. I have had experience at Brown and UMW applying for and negotiating grants, and am glad to help in drafting a proposal.     srabson@umw.edu"
"I think that this proposed model could potentially undermine faculty autonomy and could unnecessarily diminish undergraduate teaching and the liberal arts tradition at UMW. I have additional concerns that the school director position will not be effective at recruitment and retention.

Having chairs selected by individual departments is an important way that we do faculty governance at our institution. Combining departments will decrease the number of faculty chairs, which will take away important faculty leadership roles. New roles will be created through school director positions, but these roles will be appointed by the Deans and Provost, and add another layer of administration. I worry that rather than doing effective work at recruitment and retention, these directors will come to see themselves as bosses who will tell already overtaxed faculty and staff to do this work. Through department mergers, a lot of additional work previously done by chairs will be offloaded to program directors. Right now, this model does not discuss how program directors will be compensated for this work.

By forcing department mergers and forcing departments to join other colleges against their preference, this process has the potential to undermine teaching. Many departments do not want to merge with other departments. It is disruptive and undermines how many departments think of themselves. In many instances, it has created new tensions between departments that didn't initially exist.

I believe in the benefits of a liberal arts education. I was heartened to hear how important it is for my colleagues in Computer Science to be part of this tradition. It is unconscionable that the UMW administration would take these colleagues out of the liberal arts and into the College of Business against their will.

","This whole process has been extremely disruptive. So much of our week is spent on this issue. It's caused hurt feelings, sadness, and ill will that was not widespread a year ago. And I still don't understand why, other than ""we need to balance the workload of the deans"" and a ""higher education is in crisis so we need to do something to do something"" kind of feeling.","- Do not merge departments if it is not their preference to merge.
- Do not add Computer Science and Math to the College of Business unless it is their preference.
- Adhere to the faculty handbook. If there is ambiguity in the handbook text, err on the side of favoring faculty governance.
- Go back and reconsider some of the ideas suggested in the working group report."
"The proposed model, whether adopted or not, has weakened the organization of UMW by the way the process was presented and handled, damaging the relationship between faculty and administration. The delivered product is inconsistent with the message presented during the fall semester. From the COE perspective, the 2/2 plan resembles what we expected. It doesn't really change anything in terms of our work or afford new opportunities.","I do not see the proposed plan helping to remedy the disproportionate service burden of COE faculty. Other than superficial similarities, I do not see the potential for ""creating synergies"" within our new academic unit that has been espoused as one of the goals for the plan. Synergies can be created across academic structure without impediment if they make sense.","Focus restructuring on optimizing degree programs (the primary catalyst for this initiative) rather than administrative structure. As our colleagues have urged, take time to consider whether the proposed plan actually addresses the initial goals of this effort and what precedents are being established in adopting the current plan. Focus on structure and ideas that will directly lead to enhancing and distinguishing the student experience at UMW. Provide clear communication about purpose and intention and do not deviate from it."
"BENEFITS - I think where programs/departments were listened to and where their ideas were incorporated into the model, these changes will be beneficial. If certain programs want to have a School of the Arts and believe it would help them with fundraising, wonderful. If other departments want to create inter-disciplinary programs, again, there's a new opportunity to do so and I would support these changes.

COSTS/WEAKNESSES - This model creates far more fragmentation and division across the university that is poorly aligned with our mission as a Liberal Arts institution. If we're teaching students that the core values of critical thinking and cross-disciplinary connections are central to who we are, why then are we creating smaller umbrellas that are often poorly-suited descriptors for the departments that would be forced to occupy them? Computer Science, particularly how it is taught here from a liberal arts perspective, is not IT/Business computing. Geography is not limited to social science - rather, it includes research methods and perspectives that span from the humanities to natural science (we teach natural science labs in the gen ed after all.) I'm sure others could think of numerous examples within their own departments of how the breadth of what we do crosses disciplinary boundaries and approaches. 

Furthermore, the groupings created will likely only confuse prospective students. If you want to do pre-med, wouldn't you be in the College of Health? No, actually, you'd be in the School of Life Sciences... If you want to do math, that's a science right? No, actually you're in the College of Business. The list goes on.

Importantly, this model does not save programs as it has been billed. If the key concern is that certain major numbers are low and are thus targeted by SCHEV, the Feb. 2 model does nothing to improve this unless degree programs combine. What it does do, however, is make it easier to phase out ""dying"" programs because they're already in departments with other programs.

This model is not forward-thinking, with the exception of departments/programs who had direct input into the creation of schools or mergers. In contrast, it is a model that represents only our current problems: that we need to save money (this only saves minimal and has substantial collateral costs), that we have programs that are struggling (which again this does almost nothing to address), and that we have a three-college structure and deans with an inequitable workload. We cannot simply change for the sake of change. 

Over the past decade, I have seen UMW follow this same pattern: rather than intentionally focusing on doing a small number of things well, we try and do all the things, guessing at what students want, what will appease SCHEV, or following the model of other institutions, and we end up doing all the things rather poorly.","As has been explained by others, but it perhaps bears repeating, Geography is not exclusively a social science discipline and that is a tremendous strength and is well-aligned with UMW's mission as a Liberal Arts institution. We teach natural science lab courses in the gen ed. Until recently, we taught a quantitative methods course (we still do but we moved it to 300-level so it no longer qualified.) We also teach GIS, courses on urban planning and sacred spaces and culture, and have (well, before Monroe closed) an advanced pollen analysis lab space. Why would we want to limit our focus and, more importantly perhaps, send a message to potential students about who we are and what we teach that is far more limiting? While I fully support a move to create more interdisciplinary connections across campus, these should be organically developed. In many cases, departments know what they need but aren't given the resources or support to do so. Lastly, while I love my Sociology colleagues, we are two distinct disciplines with distinct approaches and disciplinary perspectives and methodologies. Though there is some overlap, as there are with virtually any pair of disciplines, this should not form the basis of a merger. If Sociology, as a relatively small department, needs to merge in order to create a more balanced workload or service burden, perhaps this could be a merger of department chair oversight rather than a complete merger of departments.

The Geography Department also as a strong identity for our students, which then extends to our alumni. We are often one of the biggest fundraisers for Giving Day - despite having a smaller number of majors than other departments - and our students pride themselves in being ""Geographers."" This again extends beyond the umbrella of ""social science.""

Finally, merging departments and positioning Geography within the ""social science"" umbrella does not align well with how the discipline will likely move over the next decade. FAR more jobs in Geography are in GIS than in the cultural side of Geography. Sustainability and environmental issues have, understandably, risen to the forefront of geographic research, and again this does not align with positioning Geography within any other school aside from the broader, and more apt, College of Arts and Sciences.","1. If a department is unilaterally opposed to their position in the new model, their input should be respected and the model should be adjusted. It is clear that Computer Science is a successful program and would be poorly served by moving out of COB. They should remain in CAS.

2. If a department wants to create a merger or a school, their input, too, should be respected. If there is agreement over the creation of a School of Arts, it should be created. If the new combined AACPR is supported by the faculty in those departments, again, how exciting that those programs can envision new collaborations. What is critically important though, is that the creation of new schools or new combined programs does not necessitate a complete university reorganization! (see point 3 below.)

3. Departments that do not envision themselves to fit well within a particular school should be allowed to simply remain in a College of Arts and Sciences. If Deans need to adjust their workload to be more equitable, this does not require creating formal schools, simply the movement of departments organizationally do be under the oversight of particular deans. Geography, specifically, should not be within a school and should be under the College of Arts and Sciences.

4. We should focus on doing small things well. We will fail, and have failed, when we try and do everything at once with no guiding focus or vision. We also fail whenever we try and chase what we think students want to what we think SCHEV wants. If certain majors are struggling, the Dean and Provost should work with those departments to come up with creative solutions. This might mean more cross-listed courses, more team-teaching, more interdisciplinary majors, and perhaps combining programs. Incremental changes that are intentional and well-supported have a much greater chance of success than throwing a bunch of darts at a wall and hoping a few stick.

5. IF we feel it is imperative to completely restructure the university to avoid our imminent demise, we should be given clear evidence as to why this is needed and we should strongly consider the opportunity to do away with the existing three-college structure. Both Karen Anewalt and Jackie Gallagher have devised alternative models that are more aligned with the AOWG recommendations, provide for a similar cost savings as the Feb. 2 model, and create a more equitable workload for deans than the Feb. 2 model, but avoid the pitfalls of relying on the existing three colleges. Again, this doesn't mean that programs can't create schools, such as a School of the Arts or a School of Business, but such a structure would be far more aligned with our institutional mission than creating further silos and divisions. Lastly, creating ONE college and many schools would be an increased opportunity for fundraising as a wealthy donor might consider donating to create a named School of Business - which sounds far more prestigious.

I finally want to add that faculty are not complaining just for the sake of complaining. Those of us who are concerned about the Feb. 2 model see significant flaws in the proposed reorganization that will ultimately hinder our future endeavors."
"I think that the idea of making larger units bringing together majors in larger departments (or schools) is a good idea in general. Having majors sharing a department does not work against the interests of those majors. In fact, there is a potential plus. We are not getting new hires. Tim made that clear. So, if we want to offer more courses to students we have to figure out how to make courses in one major also count for credit in another—that is the promise of a more interdisciplinary approach, and it is also more in keeping what scholarship already does, not to mention that it makes the idea of the liberal arts more clear to students. Most of us in the social sciences and humanities not only share topics that interest us but also methods and data.   Me personally, I think interdisciplinarity should go even farther than it has on the proposed plan. ",The proposal improves my program's capacity to engage with academic peers to produce classes that will shore up weaknesses in terms of staffing in our individual programs.,"I do not think that the administration has offered a robust and articulate rationale for the reorganization as a whole. That rationale requires data. To me a better idea would be to eliminate the three college model and integrate COE and COB into Mary Washington College. COB and COE could be renamed as schools, tasks of deans could be right-sized, Commuter Science should be joined with math as a separate school. From what I gather we are banking on expanding enrollment over the next several years to 4000 from the current number. We should not bank on graduate student enrollment doing any of that lifting. It seems that the current model on offer makes the same mistake we made in 2009-10. The data are not showing a path forward there. 
Here, for example, are some interesting data. Our enrollment peeked in 2009. We had 4397 UG and 983 Grads. Both numbers have declined steadily since. We now have 3611 UG and 197 G. This decline has hit all programs, not just a select few. So, for example, business UG degrees awarded peeked in 2018-19 at 177, and is now back to what it was (133) in the late 1990s. And as we were reminded in the beginning of the semester our current UG enrollment is on par with what it was in the mid 1990s. But in 2023 we have 173,00 UGs in Publics while in early 90s it was 117,000.  The upshot is that not only are we getting fewer students as a proportion of the total but that we are unable to maintain the quality of the students we have gotten.

It may be that our biggest immediate problem has been the decline in out-of-state admissions. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, out-of-state students were more than 25 percent of a given class and they scored higher on SATs, giving us a higher ranking in US News and World Report for example. In absolute numbers out-of-state students reached their peak of 1028 in Fall 2006. By Fall 2012 they were at 546, or less than 12 percent of total. Now they are at 357 or less than 11 percent. What explains the drop? Could it have something to do with branding? In the early 2000s Mary Washington was a liberal arts college—and a fairly cheap one. Once it became a regional university it may have lost its luster. Now that we are back on the liberal arts list, we might be able to climb up in the rankings (currently we are ranked 154th for national liberal arts, St. Mary’s Maryland is tied for 82nd. and W and L is 21st while U of Richmond is 25th).. But we’d need to focus on the small ball stuff to do that (e.g. raising the number of classes we teach below the sweet spot of 20; getting more students to submit SATs; only 28 percent of our students do; getting fewer students to transfer out; right now more than a quarter do). It also may be the case that we continue to search for out-of-state students in the Northeast—a, dare one say, overfished, pool with plenty of really good LA schools flashing big tuition discounts as bait—rather than in emerging locations like Texas or Florida. 

Despite all the talk about declining UG enrollment and all the worry that programs might have to close programs to satisfy SCHEV or our board that we are cutting costs and not wasting valuable faculty slots on under-enrolled majors, a more pressing problem is the nosedive in grad enrollments. Sadly, in 2010s we banked on grad enrollment for our long-term health. That is why we created three colleges. And it is probably the case that we continue to bank on enrollments in those colleges (both UG and G) growing rather than continuing to shrink. The reorganization stems from the ongoing hope that COE and COB, if also comprising other majors that signal jobs, and growth, will be our future.  My sense is that we have very little control over what prospective teachers or MBA seekers want and no amount of reorg will give us more control. The market, as it were, will decide. Until teachers earn far more, MEDs will not find many takers. Ditto for MBAs. There are 18 AACSB schools in VA! Online means more choice!"
"As a staff member, the apparent disconnect/disagreements between faculty and administrators on the proposed model is concerning. Dr. Paino's stated apprehension to a reorganization is also concerning. From the perspective of a staff member outside of those affected directly by the proposed reorganization, my money would be on weakening things at the university level if the proposed reorganization goes through. Even if approved, I worry about the likelihood of how new interdisciplinary partnerships will come about. This is the objective that is most tied to actually serving current students and recruiting new students. This should be our main focus as an institution right now. I feel the work these past few months put into different organizational models would have been better served researching the desired new programs of potential students in our region and tasking departments to work together to develop these new programs. There are some really good ideas put forth in the Report of the AOWG from 12/1/23, most of which have to do with curriculum (new majors/programs/partnerships/procedures), our academic calendar (yes, ending the semester by Thanksgiving is an EXCELLENT idea!), and reassessing the FSEM experience. Reading the report, it seems obvious that the best ideas within it can be accomplished without a total reorganization of the Academic Affairs structure that will be a lengthy and laborious process that clearly will disappoint many individuals. I also worry at this particular moment with regard to our enrollment how reorganizing our structure will look to outsiders, prospective students, and parents of prospective students. Perception is often reality. Seeing a small school with enrollment down between 10-15% from 10 years ago go through a major organizational change is going to raise eyebrows no matter how great the reasons and marketing behind it may be. This should not be taken lightly.",N/A,"I would like to see the metrics for success after implementation of the proposed reorganization model. What are the goals as they relate to retention and recruitment and when are they hoped to be achieved? Implementing a major change to the structure of our academic organization without having specific outlined measures for success seems like a major oversight of this process. It is acknowledged that this reorganization would not serve as a panacea, but that does not mean the AWOG and administrators cannot provide specific metrics for success from an enrollment aspect.  "
"I can see that some departments prefer to be clustered, and others do not; I see a lot of benefit to interdisciplinary studies, which we already do fairly well, and prefer that we return to being a single college.  However, I understand clustering for administrative reasons, and clustering for creation of schools if that is the strong preference of the faculty involved. I can see that this Feb 2 model creates a new CoBCS and many of those faculty are very opposed to leaving the CAS. I don't understand why, as it appears to present as weak what is actually a strong program in CPSC. I don't know what it does for MATH. Given the different opinions, a mixed model with schools and 'admin units' that maintains COB and CAS, and maybe COEH, but that affords more flexibility going into the future makes more sense to me.","It is entirely disruptive. Geography is very interdisciplinary, as are many other subjects! Our faculty could fit in many places, but we are stronger if we remain interdisciplinary. We have a strong culture, an amazing connection with our current and former students, and I cannot imagine losing that.  I know that Geography will be okay if the Feb 2 model prevails, but I don't know that that is true for the sciences or for computer science. As Stephen Davies said in his letter, it feel like this is an inflection point for the institution.","https://mailumw-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/jgallagh_umw_edu/Documents/Geography%20Department/Rationale%20and%20alternate%20model.docx?d=w6d5c64e712a34c8b911144ad88c148a4&csf=1&web=1&e=Z66FIf

"To be honest, I am still unclear regarding what problem(s) this reorg is seeking to address. I have heard that there will be modest financial benefits. But do they outweigh the costs of time and energy spent -- at this point by hundreds of people -- in addition to various sundry things like new letterheads, etc.? I simply don't know.","I don't see a clear argument for how it will improve my department's operations. I do see how it might harm major recruitment (perhaps by muddling our status), or, possibly, diminish our resources and independence.",Allow departments to poll their faculty on any changes. Seek faculty self-determination. I suspect that there are many good ideas among our diverse faculty for how to improve structure. Take everything to the UFC.
"I truly don’t see many ways this reorg makes us stronger:

  * It does nothing to help lower-enrolled programs (merging degree programs, not departments does).

 * It barely changes the imbalance across the colleges (2/3 of faculty are still in CAS) meaning the disparity in service roles and UFC representation is largely unresolved.

 * I don’t believe it will help foster collaboration.  The barriers are not having a different dean/program director, but rather time, resources, and the difficulty in team-teaching courses.

 * It does come with a very modest cost savings.

The ways it weakens us far outweigh these small benefits:

 * By combining departments such as HIST/PSIA, GEOG/SOCG, making 2 out of 3 in Jepson, and 3 out of 4 in the new COB, we risk kneecapping those programs.  We dilute their identity and make them look weaker and smaller.  Tim has said that we should market programs and not departments, but I don’t think it’s quite that easy.  Students, parents, and new faculty we’re recruiting still know what departments are.  We’ll still presumably have department web pages.  Departments are the primary unit by which we communicate information, set goals, and plan.  The only benefit to this is saving a small amount of money which seems in no way worth it.  I also worry that it will lead to further weakening these programs.  Once the need to maintain a full department for these disciplines is removed, what’s to stop us from slowly phasing some of them out?  There are VERY strong programs in the list of merged departments and I believe we should work to keep them strong.

 * A huge downside which affects my own department is moving CPSC to COB.  I’ll address the specifics in the next question, but the department is unanimously against this and I’ve yet to hear any rational defense of it.

 * Finally the proposed reorg introduces a new layer of unneeded administration in the form of school directors.  This creates further distance between the dean and the faculty.  We have been told that we need to be smaller, more adaptive, etc.  If that’s the case, why are we adding more layers of administrative division?  Administrative tasks are more finely divided in this plan than before, while entire departments are merged together with nary a thought.  I see how the administrators like this plan, especially the CAS dean, but I fail to see how it helps faculty much at all.","[My answer to this question does not fit into the character limit of the survey -- this is part 1/2]

Our department has been clear and unanimous about this from the start: we do NOT want to be merged into the college of business.

Our discipline has little in common with Business.  Computer science began as a branch of mathematics and deals with algorithmic problem solving, and the mathematical analysis of problems and solutions.  Computer science fits best as a science along with mathematics, and nearly every school includes our field in either the Arts & Sciences or Engineering schools.

There is another field, Information Technology, which deals with how computer systems can be best put to use by organizations.  These fields might sound similar, but in reality are completely different.  It’s like studying mechanical engineering vs. learning to be a mechanic: they’re both valuable but are entirely different areas of study.  Putting us under Business sends a strong message that we are IT.  We already have to contend with people confusing this issue and moving us to COB will make it much worse.

One strong indicator that this pairing makes no sense is the fact that nobody has been able to come up with a coherent name for the new college.  Early AOWG models had “Business and Technology” which is again NOT what computer science is about and evinces the narrow and distorted view the administrators seem to have of our field.  The model proposed by the admin. in February has the college called “Business and Computational Sciences” which is equally bad.  Computational science is the application of computer science to solve difficult problems in other fields (most usually the hard sciences).  Calling the new college that makes no sense, as that’s not our focus and we aren’t grouped with the other sciences.  I know the names for the various computer-related fields are super confusing and don’t expect anyone to know any of this, but do not understand why the administrators have made assumptions about what makes sense for us and refuse to listen when we tell them their assumptions are wrong.

My trepidation over this decision has only been solidified into real fear during our initial interactions with the COB dean.  The following has come out during our meetings with her:

 * She does not seem to understand what computer science is.  She remarked to a colleague that we teach “pretty much the same stuff” as COB and later said that she was surprised math was grouped with us, since math and computer science have so little to do with each other.  Computer science is in reality a sub-discipline of mathematics.  Her saying these things falls in line with the CS=IT misconception that we are so adamantly working against.

 * In my own meeting with her, I told her that we work together as a department to set goals and reach decisions and that the chair doesn’t make unilateral decisions.  She told me that would have to change and that the chair’s job is too implement the college strategy.  As an example, she said that electives should not be offered based on faculty and student interest, but rather on whether the topic works toward that strategy.  She also said that she did not want faculty researching areas outside of their specialty.  I asked about interdisciplinary research, and she told me it was OK as a side thing, but not your main professional development.  This is antithetical to my views on academic freedom, which I think are shared by CAS broadly.

 * In my meeting with her she also said that there “would be asks” of our department, and gave the example of us teaching Excel courses to their students.  This is exactly the kind of IT topic that we do not have expertise or interest in.  Moreover, the courses for our major are over-full and we struggle to schedule to meet the demands of our computer science, cybersecurity, and new data science programs.  We could not handle “asks” like these even if they were in our wheelhouse.","Do not move CPSC into COB.  Do not merge departments that do not want to be merged.  Take the parts of the plan that make sense and have a reasonable level of support (such as the AACPR department and school of the arts) and begin implementing them.  Talk with the faculty in departments who are telling you they are not happy with the plan and work towards a solution with them.

I am biased because my department objects to our part in the reorg perhaps more strongly than any other, but I truly believe I would struggle to come up with a plan which is worse than this.  It barely makes a change to the size differences amongst the colleges.  We could have fixed this with Colleges of the Arts, Sciences, and Humanities (or Arts and Humanities/Sciences/Professional Programs).  It barely makes any change to the budget.  If we were to make substantial gains in either of those areas, I think most faculty would be willing to put up with disruption.  Instead the plan keeps most things the same, while making hugely disruptive changes to a small number of departments (CPSC/PSIA/HIST/GEOG/Jepson) against their wishes, with little tangible benefit.

I urge the administrators to listen to faculty and adapt the plan based on our feedback.  I also fully support the plans put forth by the Geography department which fix many of the flaws in the administration’s plan.  I understand the desire to just be done with this, but making the wrong decision will have massive consequences for decades to come."
,"[My answer to this question does not fit into the character limit of the survey -- this is part 2/2]

We have brought these concerns to Tim, who told us not to worry, that UMW values academic freedom and that our department won’t be coerced into anything like office software IT courses.  However, I am not totally reassured by that.  Based on our interactions, I believe we will be at odds with the COB dean, as she doesn’t seem to understand our discipline, or have much interest in learning about it.  The difference in culture between our department and COB is just too much.  I honestly cannot see how this won’t be a complete disaster for all involved.

The most exasperating thing about this plan for my department is that I really cannot understand the reasons for it.  It’s not that I simply disagree with the reasoning given. I mean that I *literally cannot comprehend* the logic behind it.  Tim has given us the following as reasons for the move:

 * Pretty much nobody else is doing this, so we would be distinctive – There is a reason nobody else is doing this, which is that it doesn’t make sense!  Nobody else has a department of Dance and Biology either, but that doesn’t make it a good idea.

 * It would let us collaborate with people in COB – Again I do not understand how having the same dean makes collaboration easier.  We do have some small curricular collaboration with COB (our data science minor allows 1 or 2 of their analytics classes).  Where there is mutual interest and benefit we can collaborate just as easily from within CAS.  The only type of collaboration made easier by us being in COB is forced collaboration, where we are given a mandate to support their programs in some way.

 * The COB dean is working with the career center and can help our students find jobs and internships – we are perhaps the department that least needs this kind of help!  It’s great that there is extra support for students hunting for jobs, but why should it be for any one department in particular (least of all us)??
 * We will get extra support in general – we do not know specifically what is meant by this and follow-up questions have made it no more clear.  Based on how administrators have treated our ideas throughout this process I am not sure if this “support” is something we will need or even want.

The lack of any kind of sense behind the reasons we’ve been given for this pairing makes me question whether there’s some other reason that we’re not being told.  I truly do not understand why else this would even be considered.  We are a very strong program with 282 declared majors across computer science and cybersecurity.  Nearly all of our graduates get jobs in their field soon upon graduation.  We are active and innovative with regards to curriculum, having launched the cybersecurity program, and leading the development of the data science program just over the last few years.  I truly cannot understand the motivations to risk messing that up by moving us someplace we unanimously do not want to be.",
"I see the model as deeply problematic for a number of reasons: it doesn't meet the goal of cutting costs very much for the upheaval it causes, it doesn't seem to have clear rationale for merging departments/programs/schools, it doesn't address the issues of enrollment and retention, and it prevents the possibility of innovative multidisciplinarity by factionalizing us into conventional school groupings.","I teach in a department that is very diverse in approaches and methods, and the proposed merger and consolidation under the social science category works to potentially erode that in harmful ways.","Maybe this is one time for us not to blindly follow what other universities are doing. I feel that our strengths lie in a cohesive singular College of Arts and Sciences, and the goal should be to create opportunities across them, rather than new factional divisions. I already see great improvement and excitement among my first-year students, thanks to recruiting/enrollment efforts in recent years, and I think we're on a good path that this model potentially disrupts. "
"The proposed model COULD, with good leadership, enable stronger communication among the Humanities disciplines and support a Center for the Humanities that facilitated collective programming as well. That's exciting to me. 

As an overall concept, I don't think the proposed model of schools is any worse than our current one, and it's very possibly better, though I strongly wish it would also have thrown out colleges and deans. 

Much of what is upsetting people is at a level that SHOULD all still be negotiable and I urge the admin to do so: where a few individual departments go (get CPSC out of COB already), how some departments are merged, and what things will be called (e.g., GEOG actually left itself with all the 'social sciences' in its own model, but doesn't like that name). The job description of the admin positions is also problematic, but we were told those were drafts, and faculty should get deep input on clarifying and improving them.  

One more thing, colleagues: please stop suggesting the Humanities is ""only"" happy because it was unscathed as though we are being selfish. There is no division under more national pressure; Troy doesn't have to tell the Board he will resign before he cuts the Sciences even if they want him to, but he did say exactly that for the Humanities. As other have said, we haven't seen departments merge because we ARE merged already, largely old actions by admin plus some productive recent discussions. Celebrating that the university continues to believe in and support these disciplines would be more generous, in addition to showing support for the liberal arts mission.",I'm not sure that it will do either unless the admin follows through on some of the other recommendations for innovation in the December report.,"If any faculty unit unanimously objects to where they are positioned in the Groundhog Day plan, I call for the administration to come up with a different solution for that unit. (2) In particular, since the CPSC faculty unanimously believe that a Business College is the wrong place for them, I support them and ask the administration to change that part of the plan.

As stated above, I think the success of the model depends in part on the job descriptions of the chairs, directors, coordinators. Let's get that right."
"I do not see an issue with broader reorganization. I think it makes sense to address the unequal workload across the deans, and to try to group departments within schools as best as one can. While I personally don't see a logic to some of those groupings, in talking with other faculty I have heard such differing opinions that I don't think there is one correct way to organize the university.

That said, it is simply not clear to me what problem this plan accomplishes beyond the goal of redistributing some of the administrative workload. I heard the Provost estimate this would save less than $80,000 a year. If the administration said something along the lines of, ""we're in trouble and there's going to be some level of pain for everyone, so here's what we're doing and here's how much it saves,"" I believe I could get behind that better than I could the current approach.","The plan proposes combining several departments, including my own. It's not abundantly clear how this would disrupt affected departments, because all of the nuts and bolts have yet to be worked out. I am concerned that combined departments could lead to other disciplines having a larger say in how political science spends its resources, makes hires, etc. But these are all sources of anxiety rather than realized fears.

More specifically, I worry about our ability to recruit students who come to the school because of its unique location between Richmond and Washington, DC. We use our location as a major selling point to prospective students, but as one student told me in class, if we don't have a standalone department, it is a clear signal that the university values the discipline less.","I believe there is an alternative proposal being formed collaboratively, so I will defer to that."
"There are no improvements to be gained. Even the idea that departments that are in trouble because of declining enrollments will be saved under the new plan is bogus. SCHEV counts individual majors in individual programs. A forced merger, or even a voluntary merger, does not mean that the program will survive.

We do not need more administrators. The cost is fewer courses, more money, unfair division of limited funds (undergraduate research and faculty supplemental) among schools, and inadequate representation of disparate disciplines across campus. Yes, we need a person to handle external grants, review the schedule, make funding awards. Having 4-6 people responsible for shared tasks is an unnecessary division of labor.

There are far too many important tasks carried out at the department level – including recruitment and retention. As a faculty member, I see it as my job to recruit students into the major; that should not a task that falls to a school head. She can’t invite my students to her office to discuss majoring in my discipline. Curricular development, staffing plans, and course rotations are decided at the department level. How is a school head going to know what should be taught in my discipline, how often, and when? I fear that the administration does not fully appreciate all the work that is done at the department level. To replace chairs, or combine chairs, with an understanding that the school head will do that work is simply ludicrous.
",,
,"Someone has decided that we need interdisciplinarity to survive the next decade. I agree as someone who already teaches in a discipline that is interdisciplinary. Why does the administration believe that forcing departmental mergers or putting us in school silos is the only way to do this? I would become part of the social sciences, but my interests lie in the environment and sustainability. Per an original plan, the school director would encourage interdisciplinary work within a proposed school, but not across proposed schools. Currently, we are not allowed to team teach. Let’s solve that problem and I think you would be amazed at the ways we can join forces to teach the next generation. ",Several faculty have put forward alternatives. We need to actively consider these. The administration needs to be transparent about the goals of reorganization. I will reiterate what many others have said. This saves a bit of money but at tremendous cost. Faculty are angry and upset and feel completely sidelined by this process. Making us ready to face the next 10 years is a worthwhile goal but I do not believe that we must create a new layer of administration and further divide the campus into somewhat arbitrary divisions.
"Improvements: The model meets the goal of equalizing workload at the level of the deans. It allowed the small departments who wanted to strategically combine to do so (i.e. Art History, CPR...).

Weaknesses: Splitting the admin of programs into more groups rather than less. Flexibility in funding.  Decentralizing the Faculty Development, UG research grants, etc. will ultimately lead to inequities in funding of research and travel.  One need only to look at what happened when the three colleges were originally instituted.  At that time, lecturers in education were fully funded for international trips, while CAS faculty were given 68% of funding for trips.  These budgets should be overarching and independent of ""college"" to allow for flexibility.  Scheduling also needs to be done at a centralized level as the number of seats available for first-years, gen eds, etc is a university wide issue.  The school director positions are nothing more than another level of administration and the tasks written out by the CAS dean leaves one wondering what is left for the chairs to do.  The division of departments without their input or placing them in colleges against their wishes was really surprising. For example, I feel for CompSci.  They already struggle to be seen as different that IT and the plan is to have them placed in such a way that they are more likely to be confused with tech programs.   Another weakness...this is a lot of change to save relatively little money.  We are spending so much money because we have so many deans and academic administrators for so few students. Cut out one of the dean positions...that's how you save money.   If we are worried about admissions, we could have many more full-time admissions people for the cost of one dean. ","It is difficult to answer this question without knowing exactly what would be done at the department, college, and university level.  For example, who is going to evaluate my professional development each year?  Someone outside of my discipline? Who is going to create/approve my teaching schedule?  Where will budgets be housed--department or school level?  Too many unknowns to answer. ","  Publish some data that shows that the money flowing into the COB has had a positive return on investment that justifies reworking the whole university to maintain their status quo. This data could go a long way in garnering support for the plan and the continued support of AACSB status. Show us that this status is important for our bottom line given the financial situation of the university. An actionable suggestion would be to put the data forward as a convincing argument to the faculty that COB must remain in the title of one of the colleges.   If it doesn't show a positive financial impact on the university or student outcomes, an actionable item would be to scrap the COB and fold it into a general College of Arts and Sciences with one dean and three school directors for support (School of the Arts, School of Business, School of Education.  We are down many faculty positions and our student population is lower, so it makes more sense to combine rather than further separate into artificial silos. "
,"Depending on how the school of sciences is reorganized, one method (living versus non-living) would divide the chemistry program.  This would jeopardize the university maintaining its approval/certification by the American Chemical Society.  ",
"The current model, proposing a reorg of Jepson Science Center, will almost certainly weaken the departments. This model proposes two chairs (from the current 3) for over 400 majors pursuing 13 different major tracks; the reduction in leadership will likely negatively impact these students. Housing as many as 10 different of these major tracks in one department will likely impede our efforts to build student identity and community. It will also likely negatively impact recruitment (of students and new faculty), which will in turn weaken the university. 

I am also concerned about the impact of the reorg on the Computer Sciences and Math departments (as they have repeatedly voiced since the start of the reorg process), and how that will affect our ability to collaborate with them. Rather than allowing the Piscopo-Rodgers ""transformational gift"" to build further collaboration between those departments and Natural Sciences, the reorg will impose another barrier, and result in added complexity (if the Director of Natural Sciences is indeed tasked with management of the gift). ","The model was vague in terms of which faculty would end up in the two remaining departments in Jepson, and the Director and Chair positions were not well-articulated, so it is impossible to confidently predict the impacts. However, it is clear that either both chairs in Jepson will end up with more work (more students, faculty, and major tracks), or one chair will end up with a LOT more work (2x the students and faculty and major tracks). Students in Jepson are very active in research, and supporting such research requires a lot of attention and action from chairs; it is difficult to see how a significant portion of that work could be effectively handled by a director. While the director position will likely take some of the least pleasant tasks off of the Chair of what is currently Biological Sciences (who is currently responsible for the building-wide tasks), it will not likely help the Chair of Chemistry and Physics (and also Earth and Environmental Sciences?) nor the faculty and students in any obvious way. Admission, orientation, course scheduling, equipment maintenance, etc., would likely still require significant work by leadership in each discipline (rather than one director).  

Until the director and chair duties are more clearly defined, it is very difficult to see how the reorg of sciences will reduce workload/ increase efficiencies, or just add another administrative layer/ barrier between the faculty and dean.  ","Looking at the Jepson reorg: The departments currently housed in Jepson need to retain the three Chair (+ program director of Physics) structure. The reorg cannot merely consider faculty per chair calculations, nor be driven by Dean workloads. It must consider # of students/ chair and faculty, the unique workloads for faculty and chairs, and the disciplinary foci. While I can appreciate that the addition of a Director may reduce and streamline the building-wide tasks of the chair of Biological Sciences, it cannot be at the expense of a chair position in the building. 

Looking at the entire reorg: There should be less focus on the number of faculty per College/Dean, and more on natural alignments (i.e., think about it from student and discipline up, rather than from the top down). Comp Sci and Math are obviously better aligned with the sciences in Jepson than with Business. If we were able to start from scratch, a more obvious model to split the U into three colleges would be a College of Sciences (includes Math and CSci), a College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, ... leaving a College of Business + Education + Health. One Dean for each College, and Directors would only be required for the latter College (as needed for accreditation purposes, and to emphasize their distinct missions). Perhaps the other two Colleges would each retain one of the Associate Dean lines. Or, turn an Associate Dean line into a Director of Undergraduate Research, who works across all colleges. Yes, the new College of Sciences would be large, but significantly smaller than the current CAS, and its departments have similar goals and activities (and share the Piscopo-Rodgers endowment).

There are certainly several other possible arrangements (e.g., see Gallagher and Anewalt's ideas) that would unite departments/ disciplines more naturally than the Feb 2 model, and thereby be less disruptive, reflect faculty expertise and input, and pose less risk of weakening currently successful departments and demoralizing faculty. Forcing departments to change colleges and forcing mergers of departments without a clear rationale and without substantive benefits should not be considered at this time.  "
"I think on balance the proposed model could improve organization at the various levels, but I am concerned that so many of the affected faculty reject the proposed combinations/relocations.  Several people have complained about the new layer of administration, but I see this as a strength, and I’d also point out that it simply modifies two already existing layers—associate deans and chairs—in order to reframe the layer where we previously found the associate deans.  I think this innovation could relieve the need to even out faculty in the colleges—this would give the School Directors (SDs) the opportunity to work closely with faculty in their school or division, while also allowing them to collaborate laterally with the other school directors (as they would have to do, for example, in scheduling classes, but also in order to foster new collaborations within the School and across school and college divisions).  The CAS Dean would no longer have to directly oversee 20-odd chairs, plus program directors, plus nearly 200 faculty—the SDs would be able to do this, with about 40-odd faculty in each unit.  They would share responsibilities formerly taken on by associate deans, but would also, I trust, be charged to foster collaboration and innovation (there is, after all, a leadership element to this role, as I’ve heard the CAS Dean describe it). ","I see no disruption to my unit’s work.  I’ve already enjoyed conversations with others in the proposed School of Humanities (about possible alternative school titles, about the proposed Center, about our embrace of interdisciplinarity).  I might add that I’ve also enjoyed conversations with displaced Monrovians (Social Scientists!) now housed in our building—we have a big tent, come and join us!  I only see upside to this for folks in my department and school.  I do, however, want to again acknowledge my very real concern about others, differently situated in the plan, who feel strongly that the plan is disruptive for their unit.  ","I think the new SD layer of administrative support could alleviate the pressure to make the other colleges a lot bigger.  The one CAS Dean is getting more support with this reconfigured layer.  I would then let the departments decide where they want to reside.  Let Math and CPSC join what I would simply call the School of Science (perhaps as one department?).  Let Econ decide where they want to reside (I think COB is a good and not uncommon home for Econ, but really, we’re talking about 5 people).  I think COB and COE have unique needs (accreditation, community relations and partnerships, serving the schools, partnering with the business community), requiring a slightly different structure, with Associate Deans.  I personally think having Nursing and Athletics join COE makes good sense, as does Econ in COB, but again, I’d let them all vote on that and be done with it.  I do, however, think more departmental combinations might be wise—why not aim for more departments of 15-20? The key is that the faculty should come up with the combinations they think could work for them.  Also, we need to have something like Program Coordinators, to assist the Chair in matters related to the program that the Chair is not coming out of.  There should be clear responsibilities, and some compensation (which in some cases, the department itself might be able to support, for example, one course release each semester).  What cost there is to this should be more than covered if we embrace a few more combined departments.  We need to remember, too, that one size will not fit all.  And let’s make sure the Deans and Directors have a clear sense that they have to provide leadership in fostering innovation aimed at enhancing recruitment and retention: that’s the # 1 issue we face, imho.  We need to reform our committee structure, to alleviate duplication, even if we remain three colleges (there's no reason to have more than one P&T Committee, for starters)."
"Forcing academic units to change that are currently functioning well and have strong enrollment, without a clear strategic rationale, will only create pointless turmoil during an already vulnerable time for the institution - just when we are beginning to recover from the pandemic.

UMW may be stuck with the existing college structure if COB must keep its accreditation. Do we know whether adding math, economics, computer science would affect their future accreditation if the newly introduced faculty are not held to COB's current level of professional activity? Furthermore, math, computer science, and economics appear to be in unanimous agreement that merging with COB would be a strategic mistake for all programs involved. Would the normal pool of students who major in computer science no longer apply to UMW because of the department's new affiliation with COB, simply out of confusion? A lot of work and risk, but with unclear gains for the institution.

Prospective biomedical science, premed, and predental students may be confused by the College of Education and Health's title and overlook the natural sciences departments where they should really focus their attention.   
","The proposed model would have no discernable benefits for the natural sciences departments that anyone can think of. However, it would create considerable disruption and potential damage to programs. No one seems to be able to articulate a strategic rationale for collapsing the existing three natural science departments into two and adding a natural sciences school director. Managerial organization would change from three department chairs to two department chairs and a school director - three managers to still three managers, but with redistributed duties that will need to be learned and absorbed by each. Furthermore, whether all the work that needs to be done on behalf of the natural sciences programs can be reassigned in an equitable way among these positions is far from clear. 

Grouping departments by faculty whose expertise is rooted in ""living"" vs ""nonliving"" systems does not make strategic, scientific, or pedagogical sense - we do not neatly organize our courses or scientific research questions in this way, and it is misleading. Earth and Environmental Sciences, which is a strong department, is especially at risk of losing their cohesive identity and therefore, appeal to prospective students. Work flow, management, and communication will be disrupted and will need to be reconstituted. New systems to manage the different natural sciences majors and minors will need to be developed, along with management of advisees and communications with majors and alumni. Evaluation and mentorship of new faculty will need to change. New marketing and communications strategies will need to be created (including websites...and connections to old departments' websites will need to be comprehensively removed throughout the entire university's website). Accounts and budgets will need to change. Etc. The job description of the School Director is unclear. This plan appears to present only costs, extra work, and upheaval with no compensatory benefits - a ""solution"" in search of ""a problem."" ","Work in a very targeted way at the ground level with departments that are directly at risk for closure by SCHEV and negotiate mutually agreeable solutions.

"
"It is not clear to me how this proposed model furthers its intended/stated objective(s). (That said, I believe that the administration has UMW's best interests in mind, and I will positively support a final resolution even if it is not perfect.)
Some departments have signaled that they are very unhappy with the reorg model(s), some faculty vocalize strong dissatisfaction with the plan - possibly creating an environment where cooperation and satisfaction with work may decline. As for improving organization at UMW, time will tell. It stands a better chance of improving organization at UMW if most faculty demonstrate cooperation when embarking on such a significant change. ","Not enough evidence/information to determine a reasonable answer to these questions. 
","Bring COB and ECON together; but, reconsider CPSC and MATH"
"I have heard individual faculty and departments express concern about whether they are a good ""fit"" for proposed schools in relation to the earlier models that were circulated in the fall as well as the current iteration.  I think these are real concerns related to the potential that categories like the ""humanities"" or ""sciences"" get tied to the administrative school identified in the model.  Faculty who identify as humanists or scientists but are siloed in other schools need some assurance that there will be pathways for them to engage with their colleagues and participate in proposed initiatives like the Center for Humanities or the summer science institute.  Faculty don't want to be excluded.

A different but related concern is that the creation of the schools might actually hamper interdisciplinary collaboration across these categories, stifling rather than encouraging curricular innovation.  ",,"As noted above, the model needs to provide pathways or bridges that allow, encourage, and even incentivize faculty to collaborate across the newly created schools. Within the proposed administrative structure, is there an individual position or office identified that can help facilitate those collaborations and partnerships? 

If we develop new initiatives like a Center for Humanities, all humanists should be included and invited to participate even if their department has not been assigned to the School of Humanities.  Similarly, all scientists need to be included in campus-wide initiatives to advance the sciences, even if they sit in a department not formally identified as part of that school, etc.  Procedures should be put in place to ensure that this happens."
,,"The administration should take time to review the alternative models proposed, particularly the model put forward by Karen Anewalt in the discussion space document.

I also agree with the comment from a faculty member in Biology that the administration should work in a targeted way on the ground level with programs that are at risk.

If we had a different governor, we would not be undertaking this reorganization. If we are worried about SCHEV/state government closing programs, then we need to simply do what we can to shore up struggling programs and not attract the ire of SCHEV while sticking true to our institutional mission and vision."
"It looks like this change will solve a lot of enrollment problems as outlined by SCHEV. Contrary to what some faculty are saying, these changes will save a lot of programs from being eliminated. I'm all for it.",No concerns here.,None
"Beyond trying to balance out faculty committee work, I'm not sure how much this proposed plan really achieves.  Does it save any money, does it reduce administrative bureaucracy, does it address issues of academic majors with poor enrollment?",Not much impact really.  We organize things in a model that works best at an internal level and try to minimize the impact of capricious administrative decision making. ,"Nursing, Math, and Computer Science should be stationed under the proposed School of Life and Physical Sciences.  It's a far better fit from an external perspective.  If nursing shifts to the COE, a better name would be the College of Education and Health Sciences/Professions/Studies.  "
"1. There is a serious risk that admissions and retention will suffer from the proposed model. Many of my students have said they would not have applied to a UMW had there been a merged Political Science/History/International Affairs Department. This applies to other mergers of relatively healthy and large departments (I understand that the university may have to merge small and declining departments). A recent Weekly Ringer article suggested these sentiments are widespread. I have not seen any evidence to the contrary and am not convinced by the Provost's reply that marketing majors will solve the problem. Prospective students will do the research, find merged departments and some at least will decide such mergers indicate less importance given to each individual major and they will not apply to UMW. 
2. Faculty morale and retention of our best faculty will suffer from forced mergers. Senior and tenure track faculty currently have a level of certainty with departmental governance. One thing that has been an important element of my long career at UMW has been consistent governance at the department level. My department currently has a high level of internal trust and shared ideas about things like the value of research, faculty autonomy in terms of what and how to teach, and a shared interpretation of the Faculty Handbook's expectations on promotion and tenure. If we were to have a forced merger and a chair from another department, it is more than likely that expectations on all of the previous would shift and that there would be tensions as to what is normal and acceptable. I predict that if this model moves forward as is, our VERY BEST junior and senior faculty will apply for jobs elsewhere. Others will suffer from low morale and will be less likely to give the 110% that they have in the past and that we need them to give in the current climate. One of our very best senior colleagues (not in my dept) shared with me recently that in the context of the re-org plan, the only way he falls asleep at night is by saying ""I don't fucking care."" 
3. I have been at UMW for over two decades and one thing I have never heard is that chairs of departments of 8/9 faculty members have an easy job/lots of spare time. How are we to expect the colleagues willing to take on this new, extreme burden to survive and do their jobs well? Which colleagues will be willing to be chair in this new environment? ",See above--my previous comments covered 2&3,"Either of the two models Melina Patterson proposed would be an improvement. Alternatively, any model that does not forcibly merge departments that are relatively large and healthy (decline in majors not significantly below decline in student body). "
"Overall, in my opinion, given the faculty resistance, I'm not sure a wide-scale reorganization is prudent at this time. My suggestion is to make smaller incremental changes. For example, rather than computer science, math and economics moving to the college of business, perhaps just economics. I also think there are other departments that have expressed the desire to merge and I think UMW should first explore those smaller mergers. ","This will be a huge change for our college/department. No doubt. Over time, it may be a good change; however, there will be serious challenges over a three year period. ","Overall, in my opinion, given the faculty resistance, I'm not sure a wide-scale reorganization is prudent at this time. Although I believe administration certainly has the authority to implement this reorganization, I think the faculty resistance will significantly harm implementation efforts. 

My suggestion is to make smaller incremental changes. For example, rather than computer science, math and economics moving to the college of business, perhaps just economics. I also think there are other departments that have expressed the desire to merge and I think UMW should first explore those smaller mergers before implementing this larger reorganization. "
"The reorganization will strengthen the creative departments by organizing us into a school of arts, and the new role of Executive Director of the new SoA is an excellent idea. This will galvanize the externally facing efforts of the three departments and strengthen already existing collaborations within the school. ","At the department level, I am worried about Art History leaving due to the deep overlaps of the two disciplines (art history and studio art), but understand and support their plan to do so for the preservation of the major. We will need to figure out ways to maintain close connections and shared programming across the new organizational structure. ","For my department and school, it needs no changes. Thank you for working on this!"
"The biggest hit will be to faculty governance and our belief in its value here. When faculty aren't bought in, students (and future faculty) become less interested in attending or staying. People want to know--who will evaluate me? Who makes decisions for me? Will they understand my discipline, and how will those people be selected? What happens if leaders are not doing the work of representing the unit well? Who supervises them? Whereas before some leaders were selected by faculty, more often now are admin selecting people whom the faculty might not select for these roles. Without those answers, making a reasoned decision is impossible. People are reacting to the proposal in ways that follow similar patterns from the past--some opposed and very vocal, some checking out, and many/most in the middle somewhere. Some see possibility, so I hope we don't lose sight of those pieces. The humanities group and AACPR merger sound helpful and positive. Some don't feel they can trust what's been offered because it's different from what they thought was coming, or the rationale for this big change doesn't seem compelling enough. Beyond specific proposals, just our belief that we will be heard and that our input will be valued is what matters here--that said, it will be impossible to incorporate every single idea. ",Not much improvement or disruption (thought the idea of having to rebrand in any way is a cost that hasn't been mentioned much) ,"The suggestion (I think it's in one of Karen's models) to remove rigid dean oversight of or involvement in departments/colleges and reallocate their tasks to be more outward-facing/fundraising/research focused is a good one. School directors and associate deans can and should do the day-to-day work of mentoring faculty, organizing schedules, driving curriculum, managing accreditations and tenure process, etc. There is a need for department chairs but a formula to account for smaller departments vs. much larger ones would be called for."
There is a potential to improve if it is done in a more transparent way. There should be a rationale behind merging departments. Also merging just to save costs may have long run consequences. It would be helpful if the administration is transparent about their objectives.,"Specific details are still undisclosed. So it is hard to comment. Economics as a department/program under the Business school is not uncommon. It had a potential to benefit both the disciplines. But if the plan is to break departments and create three new departments with varied disciplines like Math, CPSC, Business, and Economics it is going to harm the process. It gives a confusing message to students when they register. ",Keeping the four programs in new COB with their respective chairs is the reasonable reorg. There are program specific responsibilities which will not be possible to manage for a person who is not from the discipline. With this format we can still offer interdisciplinary elective courses and co-exist productively.
"As far the Department level, it will force departments to work together a little more, but at the same time they will lose their unique identity. Maybe it help get to know each other. ","it would not affect me because I was hired to supports all the departments within Jepson Science Center. 
","Not sure how the proposed model should be improved.  Definitely need a person that knows the Building, the environment, the staff and that is aware things that goes on in this particular building.  Someone from outside would be overwhelm with unknown responsibilities.  "
"Strengthen: CAS level. I do think that a new model would free up the Dean of CAS to think strategically, fund raise, etc. I can understand that the daily onslaught of management issues and crises don't leave any room to think in the important but not urgent quadrant of the Eisenhower matrix. 
Strengthen U level: Being encouraged (forced?) to think outside of our academic units (colleges and departments) will help us look towards the future. Figuring out how to package what we are selling for the students/public/government of the current times and the future is something we have to do. 

Strengthen: Been playing with the idea of ""affiliated faculty"" in other schools. 

Weaken: 
Regarding the proposed mergers-we'd need help to merge on a relationship level. Think of it as pre-marital counseling. There would need to be an investment in the people in the merged units, and we know that there's no money or talent in house to do that. 
While moving away from departments is a ""thing"" in higher ed right now, we've got to get used to the idea-as well as the fact that our professions still have the idea that merged departments are done because the programs inside of it are weak. 
There's doubt that the deans that were hired to lead COB and COE-with very specific different functions-will they be able to support these new ""adopted"" family members? 





","I'm in Jepson. I'll admit that I'm focused here. 
The Living/Nonliving division of the jepson departments is asinine and ignorant of science. Keith and Tim need to tell us that is off the table. It's distracting. 

To push PHYS/EESC/CHEM together under a single chair, who is compensated equal to CHEMPHYS alone, is disruptive. The Jepson leaders have given Keith and Tim a list of all of the things a chair does daily in Jepson FOR THE STUDENTS. Keith thinks those things can be distributed among the faculty as service (for free), but it won't work. EESC+CHEM+PHYS is 10 majors, all of which are highly sequential, with numerous prerequisites (some hidden). It can't be managed by one person.The document was sent to the Chair of UFC. I encourage the data collector from this survey to get it and attach it to the data. 

I can't even think through the impact on P&T. 



","In Jepson, keep 4 ""unit leaders"" who are compensated. 
More clearly define what the School Director will be doing versus the Chairs. 
Instead of a School Director (in addition to?) a staff member who can take care of many of the business functions of Jepson. If that person is staff, they'll have the longevity to understand the complexities of Jepson+procurement+Rogers gift. 

CPSC and Math in with Jepson?  

At a U level, build a model that is working towards a Director of Undergraduate Research and Creativity. That person can build and promote a coherent, cohesive package of what we do here (and do well) and that could be our brand. Possibly have that person be the external grants person.

"It seems the reorg will involve combining departments, which makes sense and seems to have benefits, so who will be responsible for budgets--and IF it's NOT an official ""chair,"" will those ""additional"" budget managers get additional pay?  Will support staff in the Finance area get additional pay for having to deal with additional budget managers to train/support? 

I would also like to see ACADEMIC office managers report to a DEAN'S office (instead of individual chairs) so when an office manager can't handle the admin load OR IF that office manager retires/leaves UMW, the DEAN'S office would OVERSEE/handle the ""problem""!  It would NOT be on the shoulders of Finance.... Reporting to the DEAN'S office ALLOWS that DEAN insight into departmental issues; it ALLOWS the dean to ""move"" office mangers into different ""areas"" as needed; and it also ALLOWS the dean to PAY MORE TO THOSE STRONGER office managers. 

It's important for departments to NOT rely on the various Finance depts (such as Procurement Services or Accounts Payable) to do the workload when an office manager is out or leaves UMW (a) they do NOT report to us, and (b) it can cause audit risks when our depts are asked to do the work that we're responsible for auditing ourselves....  We should NOT do the work that we're ultimately responsible for auditing. 

Finance departments should NOT be responsible for figuring out how to handle situations when office managers are out or leave UMW.

For cost saving measures, it seems we could have CAS and COE&B (to have only ONE dean for COB & COE combined...and have a chair for Education and a chair for Business???) and those TWO deans could report to the provost.  When we went to university status YEARS, high-paying admin positions grew substantially.  (IF I remember correctly, we had ONE dean who also served as Provost; now we have a Provost, associate provosts; three deans, and support staff for all of these positions AND we're in a time where there's the ""demographic cliff"" making finances a struggle....

It's positive to take action with the reorg, and I hope ""whatever is decided"" will be successful!!!"
"I just want this voice to be heard in this discussion because I know I am not the only one who feels similarly. I have largely remained silent, but I think now it is time to get something in the record. 

Do I agree with everything that has happening in the way that it has transpired no I do not. But I also believe quite frankly that some of my colleagues who are objecting are doing so with a bit of blinders on. Or perhaps not so much blinders but quite frankly arrogance. 

The academy is not what it was when we were all in school and got our terminal degrees we are not viewed as people who help young people find their paths towards some great intellectual enlightenment and meaningful place in the collective, we are viewed as a machine that turns out people with degrees for jobs. Most importantly, that is how the Commonwealth sees us.  Whether that's right or not is a bigger discussion.  I think, quite frankly, a discussion that we have already lost.

The truth is, and most of you know this, we are seen as academic elites, we are seen as those people in ivory towers spouting out what we should or should not do in society, or how the academy is the place to have the great discussions of democracy and build a stronger, equitable world.  The fact of the matter is academics is a business and right now our business model is faltering in the eyes of a good number of the people that live in the United States.

If UMW is seen as not meeting the business model, or there are departments or divisions that are struggling in terms of majors, if they are not graduating students, why would the state want to keep UMW, or our majors, or departments?  Especially if there are other universities meeting all the check boxes of the business model.

And I know people will say well that is not an acceptable reason to change things. I get it.  But I have been in this business long enough to know that I and my discipline, are completely expendable entities in the academy. And we are foolish if we do not understand that this applies to each professor and department here.

We need as a faculty to face the reality of the world that we live in. Our students do not care how we are organized, nor do their parents, nor do the businesses that hire our students.  Do any of our constituent’s care in which buildings we teach or the department with which we are joined? Having come from a family of non-college educated people they all see these types of arguments as silly and detached.  We are not helping our case.

We can argue about how this was handled.  But to what point, there were faculty involved in the reorientation plan, we knew who they were and how to get ahold of them, and we were given plenty of opportunities to voice our opinions prior to the where we are today. And so now—it seems to me—we are doing often what our students do: we have read the syllabus and we have been given opportunities to respond to the syllabus, however, now that the assignment is due, we are paying attention to what we should have been paying attention to and participating in all along. And now, we are proposing an alternative assignment because we do not like the one that has been given to which did not pay attention to in the 1st place.

How about we take the energy and the considerable talents of everybody that is a faculty member here and use our brilliance and passion to make this work.  For heaven’s sake, if you have a terminal degree, you should be able to figure out how to make this work.  I can still do my job to the same level of quality regardless of the building I am in or regardless of the other departments with whom I am attached because like all of us, I am exceptionally good at what I do.

And I do believe whether I agree with every choice or not, that the leadership team here is trying to do what they think is the best to keep us a viable institution in the Commonwealth.
We could be at one of the universities that we all know about who just simply cut programs. ",,
I understand that the model makes the number of faculty under each dean more equal.  I am ok with that.  I don't see the model really making it easier to collaborate or develop new programs as it really just moved departments around.,"I would not recommend changing the sciences in Jepson at all.  I would keep 3 chairs and 3 departments and make a school director that oversees them.  This will distribute the workload better.  

What I am most concerned about is that I have not gotten and straight and honest WHY for why we are doing this reorg.  If this is so important, the president, provost and deans should ALL tell the faculty, staff, and community the SAME REASONS behind this change.  I absolutely know that the president and provost have the authority to do this...  I just wish they would say WHY.","I would add a department chair to the science programs in Jepson.  It is that simple.

It would be an added benefit if someone could explain why CPSC was moved to the COB.  There must be logic there that we, as faculty, just don't know."

,,"Honestly I felt okay about the so-called Groundhog Day Plan except for what seemed to be a tough situation for Computer Science, and I'm both confused by and tired of some of the complaints. Nevertheless I'll say I think Karen's revised model deserves a really good look, either in first or second form she shared and taking into account the comments. It accomplishes much that the GDP did in terms of making smaller units for administration and possibly to support collaboration or innovation, which I like; it avoids a lot of the weird inconsistency of the GEOG plan;  it protects her department's program; it finally dissolves the 3 college system most of us hate; and it solves some of the angst about what dean oversees who. I didn't have a problem with the GDP school names and think the protests against them were sort of silly, but some did indeed protest, and this plan removes those names also. I don't have an opinion on whatever GW wants to call the three people below the Provost all ""deans"" or all ""associate provosts"" or a mix of it (though arguably the academic oversight person is the *most* important of those),  but the roles of those three people shouldn't have been, and should not be, the driving force of the re-org that affects a few hundred others and their positions are creating a lot of anxiety. If the issue of combined departments is still a sticking point for admin, that could still be negotiated and addressed in Karen's plan.  "
Why would AHPE be moved to COE?  ,N/A,
"My summary position: I thank my colleagues for their work, but I am discouraged about the reorganization proposal(s) and process. We have expended a great deal of faculty and staff time, energy, and anxiety on this reorganization with very little to show for it. 

My colleagues have already raised a wide variety of good points in a variety of forums, including the online interactive document and Stephen Davies's email to the faculty. I would highlight the fact (made by others) that it has never been made clear how the reorganization will increase recruitment and retention of students or increase the number of students in individual majors that are under threat. To me these seem like the most important issues on the table, and I wish we were putting our energy into solving them directly rather than in broadly reshuffling organizational structures. (For the record, I am open to some restructuring if there is a good reason for doing so.)

I also think that the university will be weakened if departments like CPSC (and perhaps the natural sciences...and perhaps others?) are forced into configurations that don't fit with their disciplinary character and operational realities. Our colleagues know their business; as long as they are getting the university's business done, let's not force unwanted changes on them.

All that being said, I promise my colleagues that departments with more than one discipline can be collegial and productive. There are a number of examples of this around campus. Please be open to changes that let us streamline a bit.","I think that practice will matter more than theory for ENLI. If reorganization brings a more top-down administrative culture, I worry about the faculty becoming more discouraged. In the absence of an adequate plan for material compensation (for example, regular COLA adjustments to salaries and research funds), a university culture that includes a fair amount of respect for faculty and departments using their own best judgments has helped make faculty feel valued and motivated.

The idea of a Center for the Humanities is intriguing. It would be great if such a center could make our activities more visible off campus (and if it could foster more work on campus). It is hard to imagine such a center amounting to more than a name, though, if there is not funding to support it.","Oh, I think we already have plenty of suggestions on the table. Again, thank you to my colleagues for caring. Now let's focus on solving practical issues directly rather than spending our effort on reorganization."
"I worry that adding more layers of administration (especially in an effort to 'fix' bad decisions made in years prior) is harmful to our university, financially and in terms of having a democratic process. I do not think our institution benefits from a further concentration of power and authority. On the contrary, I think we would better thrive if we eliminated the unnecessary dean positions and brought education and business back under the umbrella of the liberal arts. In fact, I would suggest we go all the way back and recover Mary Washington College. Within that big umbrella structure, programs could innovate and collaborate in exciting ways to make ourselves more distinctive and create a new 'buzz' about our institution. Perhaps it would even make us more attractive to out-of-state students again. ",I do not believe any of the changes proposed will hamper existing programs or program offerings (in my program or elsewhere). Which may be a problem if we do not explicitly try to make changes that will attract more students and encourage those who come to Mary Washington to stay. But I am not convinced by arguments that have been made to resist change on the basis that it will actually harm those efforts or somehow restrain a program's faculty from doing what they do best. ,"Reduce layers of administration. Disperse power. Unite all within the liberal arts. Inspire folks to feel great about their work and to propose exciting academic ventures that will 'sell' better to the public. Please please please hire someone who has expertise in marketing (not the sad, generic branding stuff we've been doing that just washes out the true Mary Wash) and do NOT rely on untrained faculty to do that work. "
,,"Model from Karen Anewalt is being referenced and is here:

"I am not clear on what the justifications are for the current reorganization plan. A clear overview of the goals and how this plan will meet those goals would help me understand the logic of the model. For this reason, I don't see how this plan would help any UMW department reach student retention, increase student enrollment, or how it supports any department's pedagogy vision -even for interdisciplinary majors and minors. ","A lot of budget related decisions are done at the department level, including hiring, sabbaticals, course offerings, service, etc. Allocating one chair for two departments without further consideration for why two departments are placed together weakens major related decisions that may, in turn, reduce student enrollment for the major. For example, something as simple as course offerings. ",One suggested amendment is to keep the chairs in their departments.  
"On the positive side, I think that the unequal distribution of resources has been a problem since the three college structure was created, or possibly back to the creation of College of Graduate and Professional Studies. Consequently, doing something to address that problem would be useful. I also thought that the rationale for creation of some schools makes sense, particularly in terms of marketing, recruitment, and community engagement. 
On the negative side, the plan proposes actions that were clearly opposed by the faculty throughout the process without providing significant effort to persuade faculty of their value. More generally, it is not clear why the best way to more effectively distribute resources is to try to even out the number of departments among deans and the number of people among departments. 
I am particularly concerned by the forced merger of departments and elimination of department chairs. Departments are groups of people with expertise in an academic area, enabling them to effectively oversee things like hiring, evaluation, and curriculum development in that area. I think these are and will continue to be important functions. The Feb 2 plan seems to view departments as nothing more than groups of people to be administered, the only thing that matters is their size. It is not clear how the important function of departments will be carried out under these merged departments. I think faculty have very legitimate concerns about what they can contribute to a merged department, where they may have little expertise in the discipline of other department members, and the extent to which their interests will be supported. The latter concern is particularly acute when members of a discipline are likely to be the minority in the merged department. 
It might be different if we were creating interdisciplinary departments to oversee interdisciplinary programs, but that is not the plan. Members of a particular discipline will still have to be responsible for that program. Since SACS requires program directors with expertise in the program area for each program, someone in each discipline is going to have to continue to carry out many of the functions of the chair. The current plan appears to be that these program directors will do this as uncompensated service. If the objective is to lower administrative costs and the best we can come up with is to cut the number of chair stipends and push the work of chairs onto uncompensated program directors, then we should just forget about the whole thing. 
It is also not clear what problems department mergers are intended to fix. We have always had variation in department size. It is my understanding that chairs of larger departments have received larger compensation in both course releases and money. I never heard of it being a problem. People who think that department mergers will solve the problem of low majors in some programs are confused. A department is not a program. SCHEV is going to count the number of anthropology majors regardless of what department anthropology is in.
Finally, I think Jason raised legitimate concerns about how students will view these merged departments. I also worry about how our alumni will perceive these changes. We have long been encouraged to build connections between our alumni and the department through things like Giving Day. How will they respond if we tell them the department they remember no longer exists. We are told that we can’t possibly revert to a department of business because of the negative impression. Shouldn’t we consider the possibility that department mergers would also give a negative impression.
","I am not opposed to the movement of Economics to the College of Business. At colleges like Mary Washington, Economics is often located in the College of Business. It is hard to say what the ultimate impact will be, but the Dean of the College of Business expressed the belief that there are opportunities for interaction between business and economics that can benefit both, while allowing us to retain connections that we currently have to some CAS programs. 
While I think the members of my department had generally come to accept moving to the college of business, I believe everyone was shocked by the proposal to merge Economics into some yet to be determined department. We are strongly opposed to losing our department and our department chair for the reasons I stated in my answer to the first question. I think doing so would turn a potentially beneficial move into a disaster.
","
I think the most important thing to do at this point is to identify the changes that have wide support and move forward with those. As for the things that are strongly opposed, if the administration has compelling evidence that they would be valuable for the university it should use that evidence to persuade people. It would make more sense to implement mergers and moves over time on a piecemeal basis than to produce a grand plan that lacks faculty support and damages the relationship between the faculty and the administration. 
I also have to say that the reorganization plan seems like a bit of a red herring. I do not see how these changes in administrative reorganization will resolve the problems that the University faces. We would be better off focusing our time and energy on actions that have a clear connection to the problems we face. For instance, how will the forced merger of departments do anything regarding the problem of low numbers of majors in some disciplines. The university created new majors while overall enrollment was falling. It is no surprise that some discipline saw a decline in majors. To deal with the problem we either need to increase overall enrollments or increase double majors. Over the last few decades, we have actually done things to discourage double majors. Disciplines have increased their required credits, in some cases to nearly 50 credits (not counting hidden requirements in the form of prerequisites), making it more difficult for a student to double major. Limiting the maximum number of credits required in a major and encouraging more cross listing of courses between majors could lower the cost of doing a double major. I don’t know whether this would work, but at least they are actions that directly relate to the underlying problem.

"I see an opportunity to realign administrative support, specifically office managers and department buyers, to provide efficiencies for the office managers/buyers and for Finance and Procurement.","The realignment is going to impact the chart of accounts, approval workflows in systems like Chrome River, MyTime and Cardinal HCM.  It's also going to impact eVA and Bank of America WORKS.  Finance and Procurement must be kept informed as departments move to new places in the org chart.","Additional professional buyers are needed in Procurement, and procurement duties and tasks removed from office managers in departments.  This will alleviate current issues and frustrations in the departments and in Procurement and Finance. The procure-to-pay process at UMW and in the Commonwealth is a series of complex processes regulated by the IRS, the Commonwealth and UMW policy.  It requires a high level of knowledge, skills and abilities, and I don't think our Office Managers are being compensated at that high level.  Office Managers will still need to be liaisons between their departments and Procurement, process receiving and continue to perform Finance-related duties (business meal forms, travel pre-approval and reimbursement requests and the like.)   Office Managers are already stretched thin and frustrated with the way they've been asked recently to cover multiple departments.  Removing procurement duties and tasks will make managing multiple departments a reasonable expectation.  I know President Paino and Craig heard from Procurement and Finance about frustrations related to the procurement process, and I believe they heard the same from a number of departments about Procurement and Finance rules.  Adding professional buyers to Procurement is a win for both sides."
"Departments appear to be arbitrarily lumped together in schools and then re-divided into new departments of 15 faculty to even out the workload.  This structure will undo departmental initiatives such as new programs (majors, minors, concentrations, etc.).  The February 2nd model creates artificial divisions and more silos between us.  The February 2nd model also divides up distribution of faculty and student resources and external grants between too many different administrators.","I was told that my day-to-day life would not change after reorganization.  But the Computer Science department was told the opposite.  They were told that the combined school of Business and Computational Sciences would create joint goals, and everyone's work would go to achieving those goals, and no one could work on their ""pet"" projects.  As academics, our ""pet"" projects are our research and service activities, and Academic Freedom allows us to pursue these activities unimpeded.  Computer Science (and I as well) have every reason to reject the February 2nd reorganization plan as a violation of Academic Freedom.  ","I support Karen Anewalt's and Computer Science's 2nd alternate model wholeheartedly, where Computer Science and Mathematics are placed together with the Sciences.  Jackie Gallagher's and Geography's models also fix many of the February 2nd model's deficiencies, assuming Humanities or the Arts are comfortable being allied with Business."
"This reorganization plan will make us look like a good community college (not where we want to be). It will undermine our appeal when UMW is compared to our peer four-year institutions that are not combining departments. It will hurt student recruitment, faculty retention and generally make Mary Washington a far less appealing place to be a faculty member or a student.  If the merger plan proceeds, we as faculty will spend an immense amount of time re-working at the multi-department level things that have already been worked out within departments over time. It's like building a dozen new two-department programs all at once. Responding to this change represents a breathtakingly wasteful allocation of faculty time that could otherwise be spent on the educational program and professional development. It will take many years (if ever) for us to operate as smoothly in mega departments as we do now under the status quo","The proposal offers no benefits - all costs, particularly in the area of reorganization-related disruptions. Trying to combine departments will be an immense and highly disruptive effort, raising all kinds of questions about every aspect of our jobs. If the goal is to build a ""Lord of the Flies"" system (or actually several of them given the several combined departments being proposed), the merger plan would be mission accomplished.","1.. Any change along the lines being proposed here MUST be approved by the faculty as a whole, according to the faculty handbook. Elected representatives of the faculty should consider this matter, and then offer a plan for full faculty approval, amendment, or rejection. What we have now is a ""shoot first, aim later"" plan. This proposal is far more consequential a change than the General Education reforms the faculty handled effectively a few years ago. These proposals should be handled by faculty as those changes were. Are we not all in this together? 

2. Kill the department merger part of this plan, at least for departments with five or more tenure-line faculty members.

3. If the goal is to save money, continue offering buy-outs to faculty at or near retirement age every year or two. That would save a lot more money than would come from reducing the number of chairs.

4. If CAS needs more resources, redesign the dean/assistant dean system accordingly. This faculty reorganization plan is a really inefficient (and counterproductive) response what is really an administration resource re-allocation issue.

5. Melina Patterson's plans are far better than the proposal from the administration.

We want applicants to see Mary Washington as a great place to get a quality education in the program they care about, not a place of mega-departments that doesn’t take specific majors all that seriously. 

One final thought -- It does not make sense to make changes like this without paying more attention to our audience of future students. Before we proceed with any of these mega-departments, I would like to see evidence that this would make us more appealing to students as they consider where to go to college. I can't see how this plan would make UMW more appealing.

"My department was one selected to be merged. This means one department with four distinct programs, where one person would be chair; currently, three people manage these programs. It would be okay to be merged, in that some in my department teach and study similar subjects as the other, but some of them don't, so it is not a great fit. It would add extra meetings for all of us (some to discuss programs, some to discuss department business); it would add extra uncompensated work for the not-chair who still manages a program or two. It seems likely that our students and alumni would be confused, and while some would get used to it, my programs would have to work hard to maintain the culture and connections with students that we have established to date. Some would not get used to it and will likely be more divorced from the institution, less likely to be involved after graduation. It does feel like we are being punished for something; we are not a ""chosen"" department that is allowed to remain separate and intact.  I don't see anything in this model that strengthens the programs in my department; the school we are assigned to is okay, although I find it hard to see benefits to being in a school. Many in my department work with others already, both within and outside the boundaries of this school. I don't understand how the new plan makes the institution more attractive to students or improves our position with SCHEV.","This is an odd question because nothing is said about programs. Program changes MIGHT occur because two departments merge, but that would mean that one program disappears: is that what is anticipated? Or both disappear and a new one is proposed? Or all majors become ""general liberal arts""? Would that satisfy SCHEV? I sincerely hope that the proposed model does not disrupt my unit's existing programs. I personally view improvements coming from more interdisciplinary work, but the greater separation of CAS into schools and other colleges doesn't seem to encourage this.","This is tough, as it assumes a new organization, and I don't understand its purpose or benefits. "
"It would weaken my discipline (CPSC) by merging it with a college in which it does not belong (Business) and by separating it from disciplines it has more in common with, and could fruitfully collaborate with (the physical and social sciences, and also the humanities with whom we are jointly submitting an NSF proposal for a new AI Center for the Humanities).

The improvements seem essentially limited to making three people's workloads more similar in size. That is a minuscule win that does not begin to justify the disruption of an entire organizational overhaul.","By positioning us in a College of Business, we send a confusing message to current and potential future students about what Computer Science is. Our discipline is very likely to be further conflated with IT (Info Tech) in many people's minds.

We also send a damning message to potential future faculty -- I know that I myself would not have even considered interviewing at a school where the Comp Sci department was located in a College of Business. I feel confident that the majority, if not the vast majority, of new Ph.D.'s in our field would feel the same way. The Business setting just feels so vocational, non-technical, and cost-and-profit-centric; not at all the mathematical, algorithmic, exploratory-research-oriented liberal arts setting that Computer Science has traditionally thrived in.

Also, by giving us a Dean who does not understand what our field entails (in private conversations, she has revealed that she thinks we ""teach many of the same things"" as the Business courses do) and who puts a primacy on Business's needs over against ours (in multiple conversations, she said ""there will be asks"" of our department, including the ""ask"" to teach courses in Microsoft Office software, seemingly unaware that our CPSC courses are packed to the breaking point and that we are desperately in need of additional faculty to deliver our current program) the plan risks completely derailing one of UMW's most successful and popular programs.","Simple enough: don't wreck what we're doing well. If there are departments like ours that are thriving in the current environment, and whose faculty are unanimously and unalterably opposed to being repositioned in the way the model dictates, DON'T DO IT! I'm really not sure how to make that message any louder or clearer. You're in dangerous waters when you begin experimenting with successful programs in arbitrary ways, all because of theoretical pipe dreams about how something new might spontaneously develop later on. Keep the wins! Tinker only with what's broken, and trust the faculty to tell you about that.

It is a BAD BAD idea to put our Computer Science department in a College of Business. (From what I've heard, the Economics faculty are largely unopposed to being relocated to COB. Great! So relocate them. From what I've heard, the Mathematics faculty are largely indifferent to where they end up in the new model. Great! So relocate them. But the Computer Science faculty are NOT unopposed and are NOT indifferent. We can't even figure out, despite months of trying, what in the world the administration thinks they would accomplish by putting us there. Is it really just to make the relative sizes of the numbers in the boxes on the diagram more even? Really? Perhaps we should relocate 4 million people from New York City to Boston, because then the two metro areas would have about the same population. We all know how important it is to keep city sizes uniform!)

Please, please, I beg of you: don't ruin this institution, which has had so much going for it, by carelessly experimenting with important ingredients in the secret sauce. The chances that our administrators will have identified some magic silver bullet that will make the faculty all collaborate more and differently, and make the students develop different interests in precisely the areas we need growth, all without any repercussions for tearing up what already exists, seem quite remote, I must say. It seems much more likely that cutting apart this patient and stitching her back together in another form will have unforeseen negative consequences, even aside from simply making her dazed and disoriented."
"Improvements: Redistribution of large CAS and smaller COE/COB. Sheltering of some programs that are ""in the red"" for SCHEV. 
Weaknesses: Adding nursing and athletics to education does not alleviate the service burden, which was one rationale cited for reorganization in the first place.",n/a,Audit the number of faculty in nursing and athletics who have service expectations. Compare this with the number of faculty with service expectations in other colleges/schools. Determine if this suggested model does or does not alleviate the heavy COE service load.
"I want to echo the following comments
--ENLI colleague whose comment started with ""I think on balance the proposed model...""
--the CAS colleague whose comment started with ""I think that the idea of making larger units...""
I especially also want to echo and amplify the comments:
--the CAS colleague whose comment started with ""I just want this voice to be heard""; 
--the specific comment made by ""CAS Humanities"" starting with ""One more thing, colleagues:"" Those latter two especially those comments raise very important issues. Those of us in the humanities are under an incredible amount of national pressure. Programs are being closed and colleagues are losing their jobs. It is happening all over the country. I worry about how little faculty energy and focus has gone towards that situation.

There is no one right solution. Lots of universities are organized in lots of different ways. None of those organizational structures are perfect; most work. The ability of any model to either improve or weaken the organization depends not on the model or the president or the provost but on each of us. We can seek connections, we can seek to help, we can seek to listen to and support one another, and we can seek common ground—even across apparent “divisions”. If each of us does those things to the best of our ability, the re-org. will improve the university. If we do not, it will weaken the university. 

Faculty were given ample opportunities last semester to learn about and engage with this process. Most colleagues I know of at other universities have simply been told by their provost, after *zero* consultation: “This is the new organization. No discussion.” We are fortunate not to be in that situation.

As others have said, I'm also excited about the prospect of having a dean with more time to focus on a smaller number of departments and programs and to see the benefit that comes from that.

Nationally, we are in a period of extraordinary change in higher education.
","I agree with others that a Center for the Humanities (or some other name) would be great for the campus and its programming. In addition, so far at least, I have been in a department with mulitple disciplines for my entire academic career. Every department chair I have had has been from a field different from mine and I have been fairly treated with understanding,including in P&T. I have valued and continue to value the opportunity to learn from colleagues who approach similar issues in different ways and with different methodologies. As long as my program is respected by others, great. Having said that, I don't believe that any program should be forced into a blended department--and everyone needs to understand that change is part of the current climate in higher ed. ","Let’s please resolve this quickly so we can move on. If a department unanimously disagrees with its placement, then I want to support them in finding a solution. The most expeditious route would be for those specific department or program chairs and their faculty to work directly with the Provost and President--or whoever is appropriate--to reach a solution. Others have made some more specific suggestions.

This question would have been better worded as follows: “If you support the proposed model, please state that. If you believe the proposed model needs improvement or amendment, please offer specific, preferably actionable, suggestions...” 

Finally: I'll echo those who have said ""Thank you for working on this!"""
"Organization is weakened at the school and department levels in the proposed model where fewer people in leadership positions (program directors/chairs) are now supposed to be doing more work for lesser pay. While this is may be a cost savings measure at the ""middle management"" level (one which used to provide the opportunity to gain leadership experience), it thrusts more work on those already overburdened with an increasing workload. What training will be provided when departments/programs are merged? There was NONE by any member of the current leadership (Dean's office, Provost's office) when Chemistry and Physics were merged. How will this restructuring aid in ""saving"" programs with low enrollments? Again, none of this has been explained to the ""poster child"" CHEM/PHYS department, and Physics is still in the red. This reorganization model doesn't do anything innovative-- it simply shuffles departments around and allegedly saves money. It doesn't demonstrate how such a structure will improve recruitment of students or keep them at UMW once they are here. Will program directors/chairs with more faculty and students to manage be engaged with the current students? Will they have the time and energy to engage with prospective students? We promote Mary Washington as a place where interactions are paramount, where bonds and connections are made between students and faculty-- will this still be the case when program directors/chairs are now more focused on additional faculty, tasks, etc.? ","While the proposed plan for the School of Life and Physical Sciences does not explicitly describe how 3 current departments will be reorganized into 2, the CAS Dean in meeting with the stakeholders in the Jepson Science Center discussed splitting faculty explicitly into Life Sciences and Physical Sciences. This will certainly negatively impact the Chemistry program's current approval by the American Chemical Society (ACS) to offer certified degrees. As was provided to the Dean in advance of the meeting, the ACS has certain non-negotiables attributed to approved programs. The splitting of Chemistry into Life Sciences and Physical Sciences divides the faculty since we fall into different classifications. We would be supervised by two different program directors, affecting our autonomy over curriculum, budget, etc.-- minimum requirements to maintain our approval. The ability to offer a certified degree (CACS vs. the traditional CHEM) is a recruiting and retention tool we use, and we have been very successful! This approval by the ACS will certainly be lost.
Moreover, members of the program have always been supportive of each other, attending each other's classes, discussing teaching innovations, working together/discussing research projects and sharing service responsibilities. A division as the Dean more than implied would destroy much if not all of this. ","The departments/programs in the Jepson Science Center should be left as they are; the administration should focus on the last word in the name of that building-- CENTER! We are a unified ""center"" already. We support each other in educating students in the art and practice of doing science through our own individual disciplines! Call us a CENTER-- don't reorganize this particular unit because it doesn't improve anything. We already have demonstrated success in recruiting and retaining students. Our current organization (3 departments with 3 chairs and a program director) works for us. We bring in grants, present and publish with students and maintain connections with alumni. We are a Center (an interdisciplinary unit focused around a common goal)-- which is the direction the models should be looking at-- not schools or colleges. This should be supported by making sure that our current building leadership (3 chairs and a program director) have the resources they need to promote the teaching and learning of science through classroom and laboratory instruction and undergraduate research. Instead of decreasing the leadership in the Jepson Science CENTER (and increasing the chair workload), increase what we can do with a grants officer/undergraduate research officer to manage the $30 million Rogers gift and other grants that the faculty have been bringing in.

"The proposed model can help distribute the work of deans more evenly at the college level. It 'may' reduce some administration cost, but no specific numbers are really calculated and provided. 

On the downside, the proposed model could lead to identity confusion for students and faculty at the department or school level. The chairs in merged departments could lack the knowledge of specific programs or disciplines and limit their development. Also, the proposed model doesn't show how to promote student enrollment..","Geography itself is a cross-disciplinary field, covering physical environment, human environment, and geospatial technologies (GIS). I cannot see how merging geography with other programs (e.g., sociology) help promote student enrollment and improve their study experience. Instead, the merge will lead to identity confusion for the students and alumni. Also, the name of new school (i.e., social sciences) where geography is planned to place cannot reflect some major concentrations of the discipline, such as physical geography and geospatial technologies (GIS), which can make some faculty uncomfortable.","I suggest leaving the decisions on department merging to departments themselves. This can help get the maximal benefits for the departments or programs. Also, the new school names should be able to accurately reflect the programs/departments involved. There should be institutional support on cross-disciplinary efforts, such as recognizing co-teaching, counting the second major for double major students, and providing forums for communicating research ideas. To reduce the cost at the department level, the compensation of the department chairs could vary based on the department size."
"Merging departments in Jepson will significantly undermine the efficiency of our programs.  There is simply too much “work” to do on a programmatic (departmental) level to merge CHEM/PHYS with EESC, for example.  All recruiting of students is done at the program/department level; ditto for scheduling courses; hiring adjunct faculty; advising students of the various majors/minors; managing current student lab aides, UG researchers; etc.  Faculty in Jepson already collaborate and co-advise students on a variety of research projects.  Our faculty have secured large external grants.  We don’t need to merge departments to achieve cohesiveness or be more successful (we’re already doing great work across programs).  Recruitment and retention of students will be seriously hurt if one of the chair-ships in Jepson is eliminated, especially with the new transformational gift.  If other programs want to merge (Art History, Anthropology, Classics, or departments in Humanities) then they should be encouraged to do so.  The Jepson Leadership already presented Provost O’Donnell and the UFC Leaders with a Rationale as to why merging departments in Jepson will undermine our programs, so I won’t go into details here.  Suffice it to say that faculty in Jepson are extremely unhappy with the Reorg plan, and morale is low.  None of the Reorg models proposed the elimination of chairs/departments in Jepson, so we were blind-sided by the Provost’s plan.  ","Please see the document shared by the Jepson Leadership (the three current chairs, Physics Program Coordinator, and Assoc. Dean of CAS Grant Woodwell) with the Provost and UFC Chair (plus science rep Davis Oldham).  That document highlights why the proposed Reorg model would disrupt (harm) Jepson programs.","Departments in Jepson should not be merged, and CPSC should not be forced to join COB (nor should ECON if they don’t wish to be in COB).  Alternative models like Karen Anewalt’s should be considered.  Both of her models are preferable (in my opinion) to the Provost’s model (what some are calling the Groundhog Day Model) or even the models proposed by Geography.  UMW should give serious consideration to having a single person oversee Undergraduate Research; this position could be responsible for managing Research & Creativity Day, UGR proposals, marketing and outreach associated with UG research (w/ Admissions), and so forth.  A single point person should also probably be responsible for scheduling across the University, and for managing (coordinating) external grants (this would not have to be the same person).  De-centralizing some of these tasks just doesn’t make sense for an institution the size of Mary Washington; in fact decentralization of these responsibilities seems very inefficient!  Funding School Directors on the backs of current chairs is not wise; a School Director in Jepson, for example, will not reduce the workload of current chairs/PC by much—if at all.  Jepson needs a classified position to manage equipment, service contracts, and safety issues (chemical inventory, eyewashes/showers, etc.).  UMW needs a second person to manage the ~ $30 million transformational gift."
"As stated by many others, the proposed model somewhat lessens the workload of the CAS Dean, but not significantly. Creating schools may support marketing of those programs, however, if the groupings are confusing, any positives may be overshadowed. I agree with the many that the proposed plan does not help many of the issues we believed were important to focus on when the committee was formed.","The proposed model places CPSC in a place that does not fit mainstream academia. How programs are organized says lots about what the programs offer. As many others have said, our CPSC is not IT, but placing it in business says otherwise. This same issue occurs when merging departments. Two departments together may send the wrong message to our students. The wrong message will be detrimental to any department.","Faculty know their expertise and faculty know what messaging needs to be said about their own department. As seen in this survey and lengthy discussion in the other document, faculty have ideas with rationale to back them up. I agree with the unanimous opinions of my department stated many times in this survey. Moving CPSC to COB will be detrimental. Merging departments will send incorrect messages to students and put undue workload on a single chair. I fully support the two models proposed by Karen Anewalt and Jackie Gallagher. I believe both show promise and can be modified if needed. Both address many more of the goals than the proposed plan."
"How the Model Weakens the Current University Structure: 

No one has been able to clearly articulate the benefits of the model beyond that it saves a $80K and reduces the CAS Dean workload.   I argue that proposed model doesn’t do that much to balance the Dean workloads.  And the proposed model only saves substantial money if department mergers are forced, something I oppose (along with many faculty).  And the proposed model does not appear to significantly address the other goals of the reorganization process.   

The proposed model provides these potentially small benefits at potentially great costs.  There are risks to morale as uncompensated tasks are heaped unevenly onto programs that are forced to merge.  There are risks to department identity as departments are shifted to different colleges with different goals and priorities.  There are risks to fundraising as alumni feel less connected to a newly designed version of their home department or feel mislead as Foundation accounts of previously separate departments are combined.  Are the risks really worth these small savings?  Perhaps if the benefits of the model could be clearly articulated, then faculty could buy-in to the proposed model but the perceived benefits remain largely unknown.  

So far the only reported benefit that I’ve heard is that Humanities faculty have enjoyed meeting with one another and feel a renewed energy for collaboration and innovation.  While we definitely want to maintain that benefit, it doesn’t seem to warrant a reorganization of the entire university.  The Humanities faculty could meet regularly even if we maintained the current university structure. 

Currently CAS is significantly larger than COE and COB.  The proposed model does little to make the colleges more equal in size.  In the proposed model, CAS is more than triple the size of COB&CS and five times the size of CoE&H.  Maintaining three colleges of quite different sizes perpetuates the idea that we need different processes for different colleges and should have different proportions of college representation among governance/committee structures. The 3-college structure sets up a competition for resources among the three colleges and creates different messaging from three different deans to three different audiences. Rather than uniting departments in open collaboration, the proposed model maintains division and perpetuates an atmosphere of “us vs them” among the colleges and potentially competition among different schools which may get different resource allocations for things like faculty travel grants.

At the beginning, the primary goal was to figure out ways to strengthen or hide the programs identified by SCHEV as under-enrolled.  It is hard to imagine how the proposed model’s shuffling of MATH, CPSC, and ECON to COB along with moving AHPE and NURS to COE is going to help the degree programs that were identified as under-enrolled.  The best way to strengthen all programs is to maximize the potential for collaboration with other disciplines, which may increase student interest in an area of study or may yield a partnership resulting in a merged degree program while potentially maintaining a current major.  The way to do this is by removing silos rather than reinforcing them and creating additional layers of division. 

In my opinion, the proposed model doesn’t dream big enough. The proposed model emphasizes division more than collaboration and doesn’t balance the administrative workload as much as it could.  A preferable model would de-emphasize silos, introduce opportunities for faculty to identify new cross-disciplinary areas of collaboration, and use fresh thought about the responsibilities assigned to the various Deans and the Provost, while maintaining cost savings and the potential to attract donors. 

","The proposed model has great potential to disrupt my unit’s existing programs and program offerings – particularly in the area of computer science and mathematics.  CPSC is a healthy program that attracts a large number of majors per year.  MATH has just redesigned its degree program to include 3 separate majors – the traditional math major, a new major in applied statistics, and a new interdisciplinary major in data science.  Allowing these departments to retain their identity is critical to both programs at this time.  Throughout the entire process, CPSC has explained that grouping their department into a College of Business (or newly titled “College of Business and something math-y”) creates a perception that the CPSC/CYBR degree program is actually an IT-focused degree, which is not the case.  

Additionally, asking these departments to join a completely different college with different goals and objectives is incredibly distracting and is creating a lot of churn for reasons that no one has been able to explain.  We have asked repeatedly for someone to explain the benefit of a move and the only answer we’ve received is that higher education is in trouble in general “we (UMW) have to do something.”  Going ahead with the proposed reorganization risks creating an additional identity crisis and distraction to both MATH and CPSC with no stated benefit for these programs or the other programs that we’re matched with. 

The only potential benefit that I’ve heard is that the COB has connections through the Center for Economic Development that may open new employment opportunities for our students.  However, if this Center has connections to employment opportunities for any major, shouldn’t they be able to make those connections without requiring the entire university to restructure?  Additionally, the employment landscape for CPSC graduates is already strong.  While national news plays up mass layoffs at some tech companies like Meta & Google, the jobs for computer scientists in the government and government contractor sectors (where most of our graduates land due to our geographic location) are strong. 

The departments of MATH & CPSC and COB are already collaborating on an interdisciplinary minor in Data Science (for almost 10 years now) and more recently, a major and certificate in Data Science.  Only a small portion of each of these departments is involved in the interdisciplinary field of Data Science and the affiliated faculty are already collaborating effectively to support the DATA programs. There’s no need to conjoin these departments in order to maintain or expand this collaboration.  In fact, the best opportunities for expansion in the field of Data Science lie in connections to faculty in social science, natural science, and humanities. Moving MATH and CPSC outside of CAS creates a new barrier for expanded collaboration in the Data Science field. 

Incidentally, the proposed name of the new College of Business, Math, Comp Sci, and Econ is the “College of Business and Computational Science.”   Some may not know, but computational science is actually an academic field that involves applying data science to natural science disciplines – things like Operations Research, Bioinformatics, and Computational Chemistry are included in this field.  This is definitely not something data science faculty are currently involved in and almost definitely will not be the focus of the Math and Computer Science departments in partnership with the College of Business.  If the mashup must remain, it needs a different name to avoid confusing external audiences who are familiar with the term “Computational Science.” 
","The proposed model doesn’t go far enough to encourage new collaboration and we can do better.  A more flexible model could encourage collaboration in two ways – first within the “column” that each department is assigned to and second across all disciplines through renewed emphasis on interdisciplinary Centers on campus.  Additionally, a flatter organizational structure for the university could reduce feelings of division and encourage a more collaborative environment. 

More can be done to balance both the Deans’ workloads and to distribute the large number of direct reports to the Provost.  Department chair leadership can be maintained while still achieving cost savings proposed in the posed model.

"Improvements Identified in the Proposed Model:

The School Director position concept has some merit and does appear to alleviate a workload issue for the CAS Dean (and is probably a status quo move for the COE and COB Dean).  It makes sense for there to be a Director-type position for some of the columns (“Schools”) in the proposed model.  In cases where faculty have said that new communication within their area has created energy and new ideas (Humanities), the Director-type position can coordinate programming (which might be monthly meetings, or colloquia, or once-a-semester retreat meetings, or something completely different).  Directors in the other columns perhaps still provide some value as coordinators (much like current Admissions Liaisons that serve different disciplines or department chairs that supervise an Office Manager shared among different departments). 

However, the School Director (or Area Director) will be most effective if departments are allowed to maintain their Department Chair leadership positions.  Asking departments to merge is problematic on many levels.  Creating a combined program in different fields (example: HIST and PSIA) creates a message that neither of these programs is healthy or a priority – which is not the case – and risks sending prospective parents and students an inaccurate message about UMW.  In other cases, creating a division will create additional labor (example: merging the 3 Jepson departments into 2 – either you diminish the importance of 2 Chem/Physics and EESC to combine them while leaving BIOL intact or you divide BIOL into two groups and pair some subset of each of the other 2 departments with these two BIOL groups.  The second option reduces efficiency by adding  a new layer of complexity for curricular decisions, scheduling, etc.  The first option seems like too many departments/degree programs to combine which would also lead to additional complexity and inefficiency.  Challenges on other proposed mergers are similar. 


",,
"The current reorganization model may weaken both the programs, departments, and the college level. Many mergers seem unconventional and lack a clear rationale for addressing the pressing enrollment issue. If the faculty members themselves cannot understand or be convinced of the purpose or objectives of the reorganization, it would be difficult for them to convey to our students and potential students the purpose of learning clearly and identify the specific professionalism of the new programs aiming for. 

Moreover, the merged and reorganized programs can easily send mixed information that neither of the original programs can stand alone with its strong offerings in the discipline. This information can easily expose the weakness of reorganizations and the enrollment challenges but not add new strength.","The social science cluster school lacks a clear focus and has reduced department chair roles. This is causing prospective students to hesitate when deciding to major in specific disciplines and departments, as they are uncertain about how credit courses are distributed. They are also unsure whether the distribution can help identify their knowledge and provide sufficient training specific to that discipline and department when they enter the job market. 

To address this issue, many faculty members will need to invest their time and energy to restructure and reorient the newly merged programs while also figuring out how to ""reintroduce their objectives to prospective students. This transition can bring greater uncertainty and take off faculty members' strengths and the established collaborative works to advise students to tailor their disciplinary-focused research for a related job market. 

As of now, current students have the ability to pursue double majors, majors, and minors, as well as other certificates, which can significantly enhance their resumes. However, with the possibility of merges, concerns arise about whether this flexibility will be retained. If departments are merged, it may become more difficult to pursue broader cross-disciplinary opportunities in the near future, which could ultimately disappear due to the added challenges of managing and accommodating merged departments.

Moreover, given the computer science department's success and increasing demand for this discipline, it would be more sensible to keep computer science/engineering as a separate department. Combining it with business programs in a merged college could convey a sense of uncertainty and weaken the department's image, rather than promoting it as a well-established one.
This could also hurt recruiting competitive students at the University level or issuing certificates to students interested in professional studies. 
","CAS faculty members have actively proposed two new mixed models that could be considered by the Provost and President. These models suggest a compromise that would prevent the departments from being forced to merge or split, which would undermine the unique disciplinary boundaries that currently exist. By maintaining these boundaries, we have a strong foundation to start with for interdisciplinary exploration and flexibility at the University level. 

To support this approach, a set of administrative units should be established that would help to coordinate different programs and departments in a flexible and efficient way. In addition, the university should provide greater support to faculty members to help them secure external funding for research and to engage with students, local communities, and even the wider national community. Through these efforts, the UMW brand can be more effectively promoted and the university's profile can be raised to new heights.
